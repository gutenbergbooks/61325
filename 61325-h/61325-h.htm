<p class="ph2">PREFACE</p></div>


<p>In adding another book to the enormous number
of works on Shakespeare, I beg indulgence for a
few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Having been for many years an ardent and a
devoted student of Shakespeare, I discovered long
ago that there was no adequate book on the Elizabethan
garden and the condition of horticulture in
Shakespeare's time. Every Shakespeare student
knows how frequently and with what subtle appreciation
Shakespeare speaks of flowers. Shakespeare
loved all the simple blossoms that "paint the meadows
with delight": he loved the mossy banks in
the forest carpeted with wild thyme and "nodding
violets" and o'er-canopied with eglantine and honeysuckle;
he loved the cowslips in their gold coats
spotted with rubies, "the azured harebells" and the
"daffodils that come before the swallow dares"; he
loved the "winking mary-buds," or marigolds, that
"ope their golden eyes" in the first beams of the
morning sun; he loved the stately flowers of stately
gardens&mdash;the delicious musk-rose, "lilies of all
kinds," and the flower-de-luce; and he loved all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
new "outlandish" flowers, such as the crown-imperial
just introduced from Constantinople and "lark's
heels trim" from the West Indies.</p>

<p>Shakespeare no doubt visited Master Tuggie's
garden at Westminster, in which Ralph Tuggie and
later his widow, "Mistress Tuggie," specialized in
carnations and gilliflowers, and the gardens of
Gerard, Parkinson, Lord Zouche, and Lord Burleigh.
In addition to these, he knew the gardens
of the fine estates in Warwickshire and the simple
cottage gardens, such as charm the American visitor
in rural England. When Shakespeare calls for a
garden scene, as he does in "Twelfth Night,"
"Romeo and Juliet," and "King Richard II," it is
the "stately garden" that he has in his mind's eye,
the finest type of a Tudor garden, with terraces,
"knots," and arbors. In "Love's Labour's Lost" is
mentioned the "curious knotted garden."</p>

<p>Realizing the importance of reproducing an accurate
representation of the garden of Shakespeare's
time the authorities at Stratford-upon-Avon have
recently rearranged "the garden" of Shakespeare's
birthplace; and the flowers of each season succeed
each other in the proper "knots" and in the true
Elizabethan atmosphere. Of recent years it has
been a fad among American garden lovers to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
apart a little space for a "Shakespeare garden,"
where a few old-fashioned English flowers are
planted in beds of somewhat formal arrangement.
These gardens are not, however, by any means replicas
of the simple garden of Shakespeare's time, or
of the stately garden as worked out by the skilful
Elizabethans.</p>

<p>It is my hope, therefore, that this book will help
those who desire a perfect Shakespeare garden, besides
giving Shakespeare lovers a new idea of the
gardens and flowers of Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>Part One is devoted to the history and evolution
of the small enclosed garden within the walls of
the medieval castle into the Garden of Delight
which Parkinson describes; the Elizabethan garden,
the herbalists and horticulturists; and the new "outlandish"
flowers. Part Two describes the flowers
mentioned by Shakespeare and much quaint flower
lore. Part Three is devoted to technical hints, instruction
and practical suggestions for making a
correct Shakespeare garden.</p>

<p>Shakespeare does not mention all the flowers that
were familiar in his day, and, therefore, I have described
in detail only those spoken of in his plays.
I have chosen only the varieties that were known to
Shakespeare; and in a Shakespeare garden only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
such specimens should be planted. For example,
it would be an anachronism to grow the superb modern
pansies, for the "pansy freaked with jet," as
Milton so beautifully calls it, is the tiny heartsease,
or "johnny-jump-up."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the carnations (or "sops-in-wine")
and gilliflowers were highly developed in
Shakespeare's day and existed in bewildering variety.</p>

<p>We read of such specimens as the Orange Tawny
Gilliflower, the Grandpère, the Lustie Gallant or
Westminster, the Queen's Gilliflower, the Dainty,
the Fair Maid of Kent or Ruffling Robin, the
Feathered Tawny, Master Bradshaw's Dainty
Lady, and Master Tuggie's Princess, besides many
other delightful names.</p>

<p>I have carefully read every word in Parkinson's
huge volume, <i>Paradisi in Sole; Paradisus Terrestris</i>
(London, 1629), to select from his practical
instructions to gardeners and also his charming bits
of description. I need not apologize for quoting so
frequently his intimate and loving characterizations
of those flowers that are "nourished up in gardens."
Take, for example, the following description of the
"Great Harwich":</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="medium">I take [says Parkinson] this goodly, great old English
Carnation as a precedent for the description of all the rest,
which for his beauty and stateliness is worthy of a prime
place. It riseth up with a great, thick, round stalk divided
into several branches, somewhat thickly set with joints, and
at every joint two long, green (rather than whitish) leaves
turning or winding two or three times round. The flowers
stand at the tops of the stalks in long, great and round
green husks, which are divided into five points, out of which
rise many long and broad pointed leaves deeply jagged at
the ends, set in order, round and comely, making a gallant,
great double Flower of a deep carnation color almost red,
spotted with many bluish spots and streaks, some greater
and some lesser, of an excellent soft, sweet scent, neither too
quick, as many others of these kinds are, nor yet too dull,
and with two whitish crooked threads like horns in the
middle. This kind never beareth many flowers, but as it is
slow in growing, so in bearing, not to be often handled,
which showeth a kind of stateliness fit to preserve the opinion
of magnificence.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will amaze the reader, perhaps, to learn that
horticulture was in such a high state of development.
Some wealthy London merchants and noblemen,
Nicholas Leate, for example, actually kept agents
traveling in the Orient and elsewhere to search for
rare bulbs and plants. Explorers in the New World
also brought home new plants and flowers. Sir
Walter Raleigh imported the sweet potato and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>bacco
(but neither is mentioned by Shakespeare)
and from the West Indies came the <i>Nasturtium Indicum</i>&mdash;"Yellow
Lark's Heels," as the Elizabethans
called it.</p>

<p>Many persons will be interested to learn the quaint
old flower names, such as "Sops-in-Wine," the
"Frantic Foolish Cowslip," "Jack-an-Apes on Horseback,"
"Love in Idleness," "Dian's Bud," etc.</p>

<p>The Elizabethans enjoyed their gardens and used
them more than we use ours to-day. They went to
them for <i>re-creation</i>&mdash;a renewing of body and refreshment
of mind and spirit. They loved their
shady walks, their pleached alleys, their flower-wreathed
arbors, their banks of thyme, rosemary,
and woodbine, their intricate "knots" bordered with
box or thrift and filled with bright blossoms, and
their labyrinths, or mazes. Garden lovers were critical
and careful about the arrangement and grouping
of their flowers. To-day we try for masses of color;
but the Elizabethans went farther than we do, for
they blended their hues and even shaded colors from
dark to light. The people of Shakespeare's day were
also fastidious about perfume values&mdash;something
we do not think about to-day. The planting of
flowers with regard to the "perfume on the air," as
Bacon describes it, was a part of ordinary garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
lore. We have altogether lost this delicacy of gardening.</p>

<p>This book was the logical sequence of a talk I
gave two years ago upon the "Gardens and Flowers
of Shakespeare's Time" at the residence of Mrs.
Charles H. Senff in New York, before the International
Garden Club. This talk was very cordially
received and was repeated by request at the home of
Mrs. Ernest H. Fahnestock, also in New York.</p>

<p>I wish to express my thanks to Mr. Norman Taylor
of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, for permission
to reprint the first chapter, which appeared in the
"Journal of the International Garden Club," of
which he is the editor. I also wish to thank Mr.
Taylor for his valued encouragement to me in the
preparation of this book.</p>

<p>I wish to direct attention to the remarkable portrait
of Nicholas Leate, one of the greatest flower
collectors of his day, photographed especially for
this book from the original portrait in oils, painted
by Daniel Mytens for the Worshipful Company of
Ironmongers, of which Leate was master in 1616,
1626, and 1627.</p>

<p>The portrait of this English worthy has never
been photographed before; and it is a great pleasure
for me to bring before the public the features and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
personality of a man who was such a deep lover of
horticulture and who held such a large place in the
London world in Shakespeare's time. The dignity,
refinement, distinction, and general atmosphere of
Nicholas Leate&mdash;and evidently Mytens painted a
direct portrait without flattery&mdash;bespeak the type of
gentleman who sought <i>re-creation</i> in gardens and
who could have held his own upon the subject with
Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Thomas More, Sir Philip Sidney,
Lord Burleigh, and Sir Henry Wotton&mdash;and,
doubtless, he knew them all.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter to have this portrait
photographed, because when the Hall of the Worshipful
Company of Ironmongers was destroyed by
a German bomb in 1917 the rescued portrait was
stored in the National Gallery. Access to the portrait
was very difficult, and it was only through the
great kindness of officials and personal friends that
a reproduction was made possible.</p>

<p>I wish, therefore, to thank the Worshipful Company
of Ironmongers for the gracious permission to
have the portrait photographed and to express my
gratitude to Mr. Collins Baker, keeper of the National
Gallery, and to Mr. Ambrose, chief clerk and
secretary of the National Gallery, for their kind co-operation;
to Mr. C. W. Carey, curator of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
Royal Holloway College Gallery, who spent two
days in photographing the masterpiece; and also to
Sir Evan Spicer of the Dulwich Gallery and to my
sister, Mrs. Carrington, through whose joint efforts
the arrangements were perfected.</p>

<p>I also wish to thank the Trustees and Guardians
of Shakespeare's Birthplace, who, through their
Secretary, Mr. F. C. Wellstood, have supplied me
with several photographs of the Shakespeare Garden
at Stratford-upon-Avon, especially taken for this
book, with permission for their reproduction.</p>

<p class="ph3">EVOLUTION OF THE SHAKESPEARE<br />
GARDEN</p></div>




<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />
<i>The Medieval Pleasance</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2a">SHAKESPEARE was familiar with two kinds
of gardens: the stately and magnificent garden
that embellished the castles and manor-houses
of the nobility and gentry; and the small and
simple garden such as he had himself at Stratford-on-Avon
and such as he walked through when he
visited Ann Hathaway in her cottage at Shottery.</p>

<p>The latter is the kind that is now associated with
Shakespeare's name; and when garden lovers devote
a section of their grounds to a "Shakespeare
garden" it is the small, enclosed garden, such as
<i>Perdita</i> must have had, that they endeavor to reproduce.</p>

<p>The small garden of Shakespeare's day, which we
so lovingly call by his name, was a little pleasure
garden&mdash;a garden to stroll in and to sit in. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
garden, moreover, had another purpose: it was intended
to supply flowers for "nosegays" and herbs
for "strewings." The Shakespeare garden was a
continuation, or development, of the Medieval
"Pleasance," where quiet ladies retired with their
embroidery frames to work and dream of their Crusader
lovers, husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers
lying in the trenches before Acre and Ascalon, or
storming the walls of Jerusalem and Jericho; where
lovers sat hand in hand listening to the songs of
birds and to the still sweeter songs from their own
palpitating hearts; where men of affairs frequently
repaired for a quiet chat, or refreshment of spirit;
and where gay groups of lords and ladies gathered
to tell stories, to enjoy the recitation of a wandering
<i>trouvère</i>, or to sing to their lutes and viols, while
jesters in doublets and hose of bright colors and
cap and bells lounged nonchalantly on the grass to
mock at all things&mdash;even love!</p>

<p>In the illuminated manuscripts of old <i>romans</i>,
such as "Huon of Bordeaux," the "Romaunt of the
Rose," "Blonde of Oxford," "Flore et Blancheflore,
Amadis de Gaul," etc., there are many charming
miniatures to illustrate the word-pictures. From
them we learn that the garden was actually within
the castle walls and <i>very</i> small. The walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
garden were broken by turrets and pierced with a
little door, usually opposite the chief entrance; the
walks were paved with brick or stone, or they were
sanded, or graveled; and at the intersection of these
walks a graceful fountain usually tossed its spray
upon the buds and blossoms. The little beds were
laid out formally and were bright with flowers,
growing singly and not in masses. Often, too, pots
or vases were placed here and there at regular intervals,
containing orange, lemon, bay, or cypress
trees, their foliage beautifully trimmed in pyramids
or globes that rose high above the tall stems. Not
infrequently the garden rejoiced in a fruit-tree, or
several fruit-trees. Stone or marble seats invitingly
awaited visitors.</p>

<p>The note here was <i>charming intimacy</i>. It was a
spot where gentleness and sweetness reigned, and
where, perforce, every flower enjoyed the air it
breathed. It was a Garden of Delight for flowers,
birds, and men.</p>

<p>To trace the formal garden to its origin would
take us far afield. We should have to go back to the
ancient Egyptians, whose symmetrical and magnificent
gardens were luxurious in the extreme; to Babylon,
whose superb "Hanging Gardens" were among
the Seven Wonders of the World; and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Romans, who are still our teachers in the matter of
beautiful gardening. The Roman villas that made
Albion beautiful, as the great estates of the nobility
and gentry make her beautiful to-day, lacked nothing
in the way of ornamental gardens. Doubtless
Pliny's garden was repeated again and again in the
outposts of the Roman Empire. From these splendid
Roman gardens tradition has been handed
down.</p>

<p>There never has been a time in the history of
England where the cultivation of the garden held
pause. There is every reason to believe that the
Anglo-Saxons were devoted to flowers. A poem in
the "Exeter Book" has the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of odors sweetest</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such as in summer's tide</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fragrance send forth in places,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fast in their stations,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Joyously o'er the plains,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Blown plants,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Honey-flowing.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No one could write "blown-plants, honey-flowing"
without a deep and sophisticated love of
flowers.</p>

<p>Every Anglo-Saxon gentleman had a <i>garth</i>, or
garden, for pleasure, and an <i>ort-garth</i> for vegetables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
In the <i>garth</i> the best loved flower was the lily, which
blossomed beside the rose, sunflower, marigold, gilliflower,
violet, periwinkle, honeysuckle, daisy, peony,
and bay-tree.</p>

<p>Under the Norman kings, particularly Henry II,
when the French and English courts were virtually
the same, the citizens of London had gardens,
"large, beautiful, and planted with various kinds of
trees." Possibly even older scribes wrote accounts
of some of these, but the earliest description of an
English garden is contained in "De Naturis Rerum"
by Alexander Neckan, who lived in the second half
of the Twelfth Century. "A garden," he says,
"should be adorned on this side with roses, lilies,
the marigold, <i>molis</i> and mandrakes; on that side
with parsley, cort, fennel, southernwood, coriander,
sage, savory, hyssop, mint, rue, dittany, smallage,
pellitory, lettuce, cresses, <i>ortulano</i>, and the peony.
Let there also be beds enriched with onions, leeks,
garlic, melons, and scallions. The garden is also
enriched by the cucumber, which creeps on its belly,
and by the soporiferous poppy, as well as by the
daffodil and the acanthus. Nor let pot-herbs be
wanting, if you can help it, such as beets, herb
mercury, orache, and the mallow. It is useful also
to the gardener to have anise, mustard, white pepper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and wormwood." And then Neckan goes on to the
fruit-trees and medicinal plants. The gardener's
tools at this time were merely a knife for grafting,
an ax, a pruning-hook, and a spade. A hundred
years later the gardens of France and England were
still about the same. When John de Garlande (an
appropriate name for an amateur horticulturist) was
studying at the University of Paris (Thirteenth Century)
he had a garden, which he described in his
"Dictionarus," quaintly speaking of himself in the
third person: "In Master John's garden are these
plants: sage, parsley, dittany, hyssop, celandine,
fennel, pellitory, the rose, the lily, the violet; and
at the side (in the hedge), the nettle, the thistle
and foxgloves. His garden also contains medicinal
herbs, namely, mercury and the mallows, agrimony
with nightshade and the marigold." Master John
had also a special garden for pot-herbs and "other
herbs good for men's bodies," i.e., medicinal herbs,
and a fruit garden, or orchard, of cherries, pears,
nuts, apples, quinces, figs, plums, and grapes. About
the same time Guillaume de Lorris wrote his
"Roman de la Rose"; and in this famous work of
the Thirteenth Century there is a most beautiful description
of the garden of the period. <i>L'Amant</i> (the
Lover) while strolling on the banks of a river discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>this enchanting spot, "full long and broad
behind high walls." It was the Garden of <i>Delight</i>,
or Pleasure, whose wife was <i>Liesse</i>, or Joy; and
here they dwelt with the sweetest of companions.
<i>L'Amant</i> wandered about until he found a small
wicket door in the wall, at which he knocked and
gained admittance. When he entered he was
charmed. Everything was so beautiful that it
seemed to him a spiritual place, better even than
Paradise could be. Now, walking down a little
path, <i>bordered with mint and fennel</i>, he reached
the spot where <i>Delight</i> and his companions were
dancing a carol to the song of Joy. <i>L'Amant</i> was
invited to join the dance; and after it was finished
he made a tour of the garden to see it all. And
through his eyes we see it, too.</p>

<p class="caption center half">FIFTEENTH CENTURY GARDEN WITHIN CASTLE WALLS, FRENCH</p>
</div>

<p>The Garden of Delight was even and square, "as
long as it was large." It contained every known
fruit-tree&mdash;peaches, plums, cherries, apples, and
quinces, as well as figs, pomegranates, dates,
almonds, chestnuts, and nutmegs. Tall pines,
cypresses, and laurels formed screens and walls of
greenery; and many a "pair" of elms, maples, ashes,
oaks, aspens, yews, and poplars kept out the sun by
their interwoven branches and protected the green
grass. And here deer browsed fearlessly and squir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>rels
"in great plenty" were seen leaping from bough
to bough. Conduits of water ran through the garden
and the moisture made the grass as thick and
rich as velvet and "the earth was as soft as a feather
bed." And, moreover, the "earth was of such a
grace" that it produced plenty of flowers, both winter
and summer:</p>

<span class="i0">And fresh periwinkle rich of hue</span><br />

<p>Myriads of birds were singing, too&mdash;larks, nightingales,
finches, thrushes, doves, and canaries.
<i>L'Amant</i> wandered on until he came to a marvelous
fountain&mdash;the Fountain of Love&mdash;under a pine-tree.</p>

<p>Presently he was attracted to a beautiful rosebush,
full of buds and full-blown roses. One bud,
sweeter and fresher than all the rest and set so
proudly on its spray, fascinated him. As he approached
this flower, <i>L'Amour</i> discharged five arrows
into his heart. The bud, of course, was the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
he was destined to love and which, after many adventures
and trials, he was eventually to pluck and
cherish.</p>

<p>This fanciful old allegory made a strong appeal
to the illustrators of the Thirteenth and later centuries;
and many beautiful editions are prized by
libraries and preserved in glass cases. The edition
from which the illustration (Fifteenth Century) is
taken is from the Harleian MS. owned by the British
Museum.</p>

<i>The Garden of Delight</i></h2></div>


<p>The old <i>trouvères</i> did not hesitate to stop the
flow of their stories to describe the delights and
beauties of the gardens. Many romantic scenes are
staged in the "Pleasance," to which lovers stole
quietly through the tiny postern gate in the walls.
When we remember what the feudal castle was,
with its high, dark walls, its gloomy towers and
loop-holes for windows, its cold floors, its secret
hiding-places, and its general gloom, it is not surprising
that the lords and ladies liked to escape into
the garden. After the long, dreary winter what joy
to see the trees burst into bloom and the tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
flowers push their way through the sweet grass!
Like the birds, the poets broke out into rapturous
song, as, for instance, in <i>Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion</i>:</p>

<p>In Chaucer's "Franklyn's Tale" <i>Dorigen</i> goes
into her garden to try to divert herself in the absence
of her husband:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>In the "Roman de Berte" <i>Charles Martel</i> dines in
the garden, when the rose is in bloom&mdash;<i>que la rose
est fleurie</i>&mdash;and in "La Mort de Garin" a big dinner-party
is given in the garden. Naturally the garden
was the place of all places for lovers. In "Blonde
of Oxford" <i>Blonde</i> and <i>Jean</i> meet in the garden
under a blossoming pear-tree, silvery in the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
moonlight, and in the "Roman of Maugis et la Belle
Oriande" the hero and heroine "met in a garden
to make merry and amuse themselves after they had
dined; and it was the time for taking a little repose.
It was in the month of May, the season when the
birds sing and when all true lovers are thinking of
their love."</p>

<p>In many of the illuminated manuscripts of these
delightful <i>romans</i> there are pictures of ladies gathering
flowers in the garden, sitting on the sward, or on
stone seats, weaving chaplets and garlands; and
these little pictures are drawn and painted with such
skill and beauty that we have no difficulty in
visualizing what life was like in a garden six hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>So valued were these gardens&mdash;not only for their
flowers but even more for the potential drugs, salves,
unguents, perfumes, and ointments they held in leaf
and petal, seed and root, in those days when every
castle had to be its own apothecary storehouse&mdash;that
the owner kept them locked and guarded the
key. Song, story, and legend are full of incidents
of the heroine's trouble in gaining possession of the
key of the postern gate in order to meet at midnight
her lover who adventurously scaled the high garden
wall. The garden was indeed the happiest and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
most romantic spot in the precincts of the feudal
castle and the baronial manor-house.</p>

<p>We do not have to depend entirely upon the
<i>trouvères</i> and poets for a knowledge of Medieval
flowers. A manuscript of the Fifteenth Century
(British Museum) contains a list of plants considered
necessary for a garden. Here it is: violets,
mallows, dandelions, mint, sage, parsley, golds,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
marjoram, fennel, caraway, red nettle, daisy,
thyme, columbine, basil, rosemary, gyllofre,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> rue,
chives, endive, red rose, poppy, cowslips of Jerusalem,
saffron, lilies, and Roman peony.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Marigolds.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Gilliflower.</p></div>

<p>Herbs and flowers were classed together. Many
were valued for culinary purposes and for medicinal
purposes. The ladies of the castle and manor-house
were learned in cookery and in the preparation of
"simples"; and they guarded, tended, and gathered
the herbs with perhaps even more care than they
gave to the flowers. Medieval pictures of ladies, in
tall peaked head dresses, fluttering veils, and graceful,
flowing robes, gathering herbs in their gardens,
are abundant in the old illustrated manuscripts.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />
<i>The Italian Renaissance Garden</i></h2></div>


<p>It is but a step from this Medieval "Pleasance"
to the Shakespeare garden. But before we try to
picture what the Tudor gardens were like it will
be worth our while to pause for a moment to consider
the Renaissance garden of Italy on which the
gardens that Shakespeare knew and loved were
modeled. No one is better qualified to speak of
these than Vernon Lee:</p>

<p>"One great charm of Renaissance gardens was
the skillful manner in which Nature and Art were
blended together. The formal design of the
<i>Giardino segreto</i> agreed with the straight lines of
the house, and the walls with their clipped hedges
led on to the wilder freer growth of woodland and
meadow, while the dense shade of the <i>bosco</i> supplied
an effective contrast to the sunny spaces of lawn and
flower-bed. The ancient practice of cutting box-trees
into fantastic shapes, known to the Romans
as the topiary art, was largely restored in the
Fifteenth Century and became an essential part of
Italian gardens. In that strange romance printed
at the Aldine Press in 1499, the <i>Hypernotomachia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of Francesco Colonna, Polyphilus and his beloved
are led through an enchanted garden where banquet-houses,
temples and statues stand in the midst of
myrtle groves and labyrinths on the banks of a
shining stream. The pages of this curious book are
adorned with a profusion of wood-cuts by some
Venetian engraver, representing pergolas, fountains,
sunk parterres, pillared <i>loggie</i>, clipped box and ilex-trees
of every variety, which give a good idea of
the garden artist then in vogue.</p>

<p>"Boccaccio and the Italians more usually employ
the word <i>orto</i>, which has lost its Latin signification,
and is a place, as we learn from the context, planted
with fruit-trees and potherbs, the sage which
brought misfortune on poor Simona and the sweet
basil which Lisabetta watered, as it grew out of
Lorenzo's head, only with rosewater, or that of
orange-flowers, or with her own tears. A friend of
mine has painted a picture of another of Boccaccio's
ladies, Madonna Dianora, visiting the garden which
the enamored Ansaldo has made to bloom in January
by magic arts; a little picture full of the quaint
lovely details of Dello's wedding-chests, the charm
of roses and lilies, the flashing fountains and birds
singing against a background of wintry trees, and
snow-shrouded fields, dainty youths and damsels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>treading their way among the flowers, looking like
tulips and ranunculus themselves in their fur and
brocade. But although in this story Boccaccio employs
the word <i>giardino</i> instead of <i>orto</i>, I think we
must imagine that magic flower garden rather as a
corner of orchard connected with fields of wheat and
olive below by the long tunnels of vine-trellis and
dying away into them with the great tufts of lavender
and rosemary and fennel on the grassy bank
under the cherry trees. This piece of terraced
ground along which the water spurted from the
dolphin's mouth, or the Siren's breasts&mdash;runs
through walled channels, refreshing impartially violets
and salads, lilies and tall, flowering onions
under the branches of the peach-tree and the pomegranate,
to where, in the shade of the great pink
Oleander tufts, it pours out below into the big tank
for the maids to rinse their linen in the evening and
the peasants to fill their cans to water the bedded
out tomatoes and the potted clove-pinks in the
shadow of the house.</p>

<p>"The Blessed Virgin's garden is like that where,
as she prays in the cool of the evening, the gracious
Gabriel flutters on to one knee (hushing the sound
of his wings lest he startle her) through the pale
green sky, the deep blue-green valley; and you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
still see in the Tuscan fields clumps of cypress,
clipped wheel shape, which might mark the very
spot."</p>

<p>I may recall here that the early Italian and
Flemish painters were fond of representing the
Madonna and the Infant Jesus in a garden; and the
garden that they pictured was always the familiar
little enclosed garden of the period. The flowers
that grew there were limited by the Church. Each
flower had its significance: the rose and the pink both
expressed divine love; the lily, purity; the violet,
humility; the strawberry, fruit and blossom, for the
fruit of the spirit and the good works of the righteous;
the clover, or trefoil, for the Trinity; and the
columbine for the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit,
because of its dove-shaped petals.</p>

<p>The enclosed garden is ancient indeed.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O garden enclosed&mdash;a garden of living waters</span><br />

<p>So sang the esthetic Solomon.</p>

<p>A garden enclosed, a garden of living waters, a
garden of perfumes&mdash;these are the motives of the
Indian gardens of the luxurious Mogul emperors,
whose reigns coincide with Tudor times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Symbolism played an important part in Indian
gardens. The beautiful garden of Babar (near
Kabul) was called the Bagh-i-vafa&mdash;"The Garden
of Fidelity." This has many points in common with
the illustration of the "Romaunt of the Rose," particularly
the high walls.</p>

<p>There is also great similarity with the gardens of
Elizabethan days. The "pleached allies" and
"knots" of the English gardens of Shakespeare's
time find equivalents in the vine pergolas and geometrical
parterres of the Mogul emperors; and the
central platform of the Mogul gardens answered the
same purpose as the banqueting-hall on the mound,
which decorated nearly every English nobleman's
garden.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<i>Bagh-i-vafa</i></h2></div>


<p>Babar's "Garden of Fidelity" was made in the
year 1508. We see Babar personally superintending
the laying out of the "four-field plot."
Two gardeners hold the measuring line and the
architect stands by with his plan. The square
enclosure at the bottom of the garden (right) is the
tank. The whole is bordered with orange and pomegranate
trees. An embassy knocks at the gate, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Babar is too absorbed in his gardening to pay any
attention to the guests.</p>

<p>Fifteen years later Babar stole three days away
from his campaign against the Afghans and visited
his beautiful garden. "Next morning," he wrote in
his "Memoirs," "I reached Bagh-i-vafa. It was the
season when the garden was in all its glory. Its
grass-plots were all covered with clover; its pomegranate
trees were entirely of a beautiful yellow
color. It was then the pomegranate season and
pomegranates were hanging red on the trees. The
orange-trees were green and cheerful, loaded with
innumerable oranges; but the best oranges were not
yet ripe. I never was so much pleased with the
'Garden of Fidelity' as on this occasion."</p>

<p class="caption center half">BABAR'S "GARDEN OF FIDELITY"</p>
</div>

<p>Several new ideas were introduced into English
gardens in the first quarter of the Sixteenth Century.
About 1525 the geometrical beds called "knots"
came into fashion, also rails for beds, also mounds,
or "mounts," and also arbors. Cardinal Wolsey had
all these novelties in his garden at Hampton Court
Palace. It was a marvelous garden, as any one who
will read Cavendish may see for himself; but Henry
VIII was not satisfied with it when he seized the
haughty Cardinal's home in 1529. So four years
later the King had an entirely new garden made at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Hampton Court (the Privy Garden is on the site
now) with gravel paths, beds cut in the grass, and
railed and raised mounds decorated with sun-dials.
Over the rails roses clambered and bloomed and the
center of each bed was adorned with a yew, juniper,
or cypress-tree. Along the walls fruit-trees were
planted&mdash;apples, pears, and damsons&mdash;and beneath
them blossomed violets, primroses, sweet williams,
gilliflowers, and other old favorites.</p>

<p>Toward the end of his reign Henry VIII turned
his attention to beautifying the grounds of Nonsuch
Palace near Ewell in Surrey. These gardens were
worthy of the magnificent buildings. A contemporary
wrote: "The Palace itself is so encompassed
with parks full of deer, delicious gardens, groves
ornamented with trellis-work, cabinets of verdure
and walks so embowered with trees that it seems to
be a place pitched upon by Pleasure herself to dwell
in along with health."</p>

<i>New Fad for Flowers</i></h2></div>


<p>An example of a typical Tudor estate, Beaufort
House, Chelsea, later Buckingham House, is said to
have been built by Sir Thomas More in 1521 and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>built
in 1586 by Sir Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury,
who died in 1615. The flowers at this period were
the same for palace and cottage. Tudor gardens
bloomed with acanthus, asphodel, auricula, anemone,
amaranth, bachelor's buttons, cornflowers or
"bottles," cowslips, daffodils, daisies, French broom
(genista), gilliflowers (three varieties), hollyhock,
iris, jasmine, lavender, lilies, lily-of-the-valley,
marigold, narcissus (yellow and white), pansies or
heartsease, peony, periwinkle, poppy, primrose,
rocket, roses, rosemary, snapdragon, stock gilliflowers,
sweet william, wallflowers, winter cherry,
violet, mint, marjoram, and other sweet-smelling
herbs.</p>

<p>During "the great and spacious time" of Queen
Elizabeth there was an enormous development in
gardens. The Queen was extremely fond of flowers
and she loved to wear them. It must have pleased
her hugely when Spenser celebrated her as "Eliza,
Queen of the Shepherds," and painted her portrait
in one of the pretty enclosed gardens, seated among
the fruit-trees, where the grass was sprinkled with
flowers:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See where she sits upon the grassy green,</span><br />
<span class="i2">O seemly sight!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yclad in scarlet, like a Maiden Queen,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And ermines white;</span><br />
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Upon her head a crimson coronet,</span><br />

<span class="i2">And primeroses green,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Embellish the sweet violet.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So fond was the Queen of gardens that Sir Philip
Sidney could think of no better way to please her
than to arrange his masque of the "May Lady" so
that it would surprise her when she was walking in
the garden at Wanstead in Essex. Then, too, in
1591, when visiting Cowdry, Elizabeth expressed a
desire to dine in the garden. A table forty-eight
yards long was accordingly laid.</p>

<p>The Tudor mansions were constantly growing in
beauty. Changes and additions were made to some
of them and many new palaces and manor-houses
were erected. Architects&mdash;among them John
Thorpe&mdash;and landscape gardeners now planned the
pleasure-grounds to enhance the beauty of the mansion
they had created, adapting the ideas of the
Italian Renaissance to the English taste. The
Elizabethan garden in their hands became a setting
for the house and it was laid out according to a
plan that harmonized with the architecture and continued
the lines of the building. The form of the
garden and the lay-out of the beds and walks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
deemed of the greatest importance. Flowers, also,
took a new place in general estimation. Adventurous
mariners constantly brought home new plants
and bulbs and seeds from the East and lately discovered
America; merchants imported strange specimens
from Turkey and Poland and far Cathay; and
travelers on the Continent opened their eyes and
secured unfamiliar curiosities and novelties. The
cultivation of flowers became a regular fad. London
merchants and wealthy noblemen considered it
the proper thing to have a few "outlandish" flowers
in their gardens; and they vied with one another to
develop "sports" and new varieties and startling
colors.</p>

<p>Listen to what an amateur gardener, William
Harrison, wrote in 1593:</p>

<p>"If you look into our gardens annexed to our
houses how wonderfully is their beauty increased,
not only with flowers and variety of curious and
costly workmanship, but also with rare and medicinable
herbs sought up in the land within these forty
years. How Art also helpeth Nature in the daily
coloring, doubling and enlarging the proportion of
one's flowers it is incredible to report, for so curious
and cunning are our gardeners now in these days
that they presume to do in manner what they list<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with Nature and moderate her course in things as
if they were her superiors. It is a world also to see
how many strange herbs, plants and annual fruits
are daily brought unto us from the Indies, Americas,
Taprobane, Canary Isles and all parts of the world.</p>

<p>"For mine own part, good reader, let me boast a
little of my garden, which is but small, and the
whole area thereof little above 300 foot of ground,
and yet, such hath been my good luck in purchase
of the variety of simples, that, notwithstanding my
small ability, there are very near 300 of one sort
and another contained therein, no one of them being
common or usually to be had. If, therefore, my
little plat void of all cost of keeping be so well furnished,
what shall we think of those of Hampton
Court, Nonesuch, Theobald's, Cobham Garden and
sundrie others appertaining to divers citizens of London
whom I could particularly name?"</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<i>Tudor Gardens</i></h2></div>


<p>Several men of the New Learning, who, like
Shakespeare, lived into the reign of James I, advanced
many steps beyond the botanists of the early
days of Queen Elizabeth. The old Herbals&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
"Great Herbal," from the French (1516) and the
"Herbals" published by William Turner, Dean of
Wells, who had a garden of his own at Kew, treat
of flowers chiefly with regard to their properties and
medical uses.</p>

<p>The Renaissance did indeed "paint the lily" and
"throw a perfume on the violet"; for the New Age
brought recognition of their esthetic qualities and
taught scholastic minds that flowers had beauty and
perfume and character as well as utilitarian qualities.
Elizabeth as Queen had very different gardens
to walk in than the little one in the Tower of London
in which she took exercise as a young Princess
in 1564.</p>

<p>Let us look at some of them. First, that of Richmond
Palace. Here the garden was surrounded by
a brick wall and in the center was "a round knot
divided into four quarters," with a yew-tree in the
center. Sixty-two fruit-trees were trained on the
wall.</p>

<p>This seems to have been of the old type&mdash;the
orchard-garden, where a few old favorite flowers
bloomed under the trees and in the central "knot,"
or bed. In the Queen's locked garden at Havering-atte-Bower
trees, grass, and sweet herbs seem to have
been more conspicuous than the flowers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Queen's gardens seem to have been overshadowed by
those of her subjects. One of the most celebrated
belonged to Lord Burleigh, and was known as Theobald's.
Paul Hentzner, a German traveler who
visited England in 1598, went to see this garden
the very day that Burleigh was buried.</p>

<p>He described it as follows:</p>

<p>"We left London in a coach in order to see the
remarkable places in its neighborhood. The first
was Theobald's, belonging to Lord Burleigh, the
Treasurer. In the Gallery was painted the
genealogy of the Kings of England. From this
place one goes into the garden, encompassed with a
moat full of water, large enough for one to have the
pleasure of going in a boat and rowing between the
shrubs. Here are great variety of trees and plants,
labyrinths made with a great deal of labor, a <i>jet
d'eau</i> with its basin of white marble and columns
and pyramids of wood and other materials up and
down the garden. After seeing these, we were led
by the gardener into the summer-house, in the lower
part of which, built semicircularly, are the twelve
Roman Emperors in white marble and a table of
touchstone. The upper part of it is set round with
cisterns of lead into which the water is conveyed
through pipes so that fish may be kept in them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in summer time they are very convenient for bathing.
In another room for entertainment near this,
and joined to it by a little bridge, was an oval table
of red marble."</p>

<p>Another and accurate picture of a stately Elizabethan
garden is by a most competent authority, Sir
Philip Sidney (1554-86), who had a superb garden
of his own in Kent. In "Arcadia" we read:</p>

<p>"Kalander one afternoon led him abroad to a
well-arrayed ground he had behind his house which
he thought to show him before his going, as the place
himself more than in any other, delighted in. The
backside of the house was neither field, garden, nor
orchard; or, rather, it was both field, garden and
orchard: for as soon as the descending of the stairs
had delivered they came into a place curiously set
with trees of the most taste-pleasing fruits; but
scarcely had they taken that into their consideration
but that they were suddenly stept into a delicate
green; on each side of the green a thicket, and behind
the thickets again new beds of flowers which
being under the trees, the trees were to them a
pavilion, and they to the trees a mosaical floor, so
that it seemed that Art therein would needs be delightful
by counterfeiting his enemy, Error, and
making order in confusion. In the midst of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>place was a fair pond, whose shaking crystal was a
perfect mirror to all the other beauties, so that it
bare show of two gardens; one in deed and the other
in shadows; and in one of the thickets was a fine
fountain."</p>

<i>Garden Pleasures</i></h2></div>


<p>There were many such splendid gardens. Shakespeare
was familiar, of course, with those of Warwickshire,
including the superb examples at Kenilworth,
and with those in the vicinity of London.</p>

<p>The Elizabethans used their gardens in many
ways. They took recreation in them in winter and
summer, and enjoyed the perfume and colors of
their flowers with an intensity of delight and appreciation
rarely found to-day. In their gardens
the serious and the frivolous walked and talked, and
here they were frequently served with refreshments.</p>

<p>It was also a fashion to use the garden as a setting
for masques and surprises, such as those Leicester
planned on a grand scale to please Queen Elizabeth
at Kenilworth. Several of Ben Jonson's entertainments
were arranged for performance on the
terrace opening from house to garden.</p>

<p>By looking into that mirror of the period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
"Euphues and His England," by John Lyly (1554-1606),
we can see two charming ladies in ruffs and
farthingales and a gallant in rich doublet and
plumed hat walking in a garden, and we gain an
idea of the kind of "garden talk" that was <i>comme
il faut</i>:</p>

<p>"One of the ladies, who delighted much in mirth,
seeing Philautus behold Camilla so steadfastly, said
unto him: 'Gentleman, what flower do you like best
in all this border? Here be fair Roses, sweet Violets,
fragrant Primroses; here be Gilliflowers, Carnations,
Sops-in-Wine, Sweet Johns, and what may
either please you for sight, or delight you with
savor. Loth we are you should have a posie of all,
yet willing to give you one, not that which shall
look best but such a one as you shall like best.'"</p>

<p>What could <i>Philautus</i> do but bow gallantly and
say: "Of all flowers, I love a fair woman."</p>

<i>Flower Lovers and Herbalists</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2">THE Elizabethan flower garden as an independent
garden came into existence about
1595. It was largely the creation of John
Parkinson (1567-1650), who seems to have been the
first person to insist that flowers were worthy of
cultivation for their beauty quite apart from their
value as medicinal herbs. Parkinson was also the
first to make of equal importance the four enclosures
of the period: (1) the garden of pleasant flowers;
(2) the kitchen garden (herbs and roots); (3) the
simples (medicinal); and (4) the orchard.</p>

<p>One would hardly expect to find such esthetic
appreciation of flowers from Parkinson, because he
was an apothecary, with a professional attitude
toward plants; and our ideas of an Elizabethan
apothecary picture a dusty seller of narcotics and
"drams of poison," like the old man to whom <i>Romeo</i>
and <i>Juliet</i> repaired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>John Parkinson was of a different type. Our
portrait illustration depicts him, wearing a stylish
Genoa velvet doublet with lace ruff and cuffs, a
man who could apparently hold his own in any company
of courtiers and men of fashion. Parkinson
knew a great many distinguished persons and entertained
visitors at his nurseries, where he must have
held them spellbound (if he talked as well as he
wrote) while he explained the beauties of a new
yellow gilliflower, the latest new scarlet martagon
lily, or the flower that he so proudly holds in his
hand&mdash;"the orange-color Nonesuch."</p>

<p>Parkinson's talents were recognized at court, for
he was appointed "Apothecary to James I." He had
a garden of his own at Long Acre, which he cultivated
with enthusiasm, raising new varieties of well-known
flowers and tending with care new specimens
of foreign importations and exotics&mdash;"outlandish
flowers" they were called in Shakespeare's day&mdash;and,
finally, writing about his floral pets with great
knowledge, keen observation, poetic insight, and
quaint charm. His great book, "Paradisi in Sole;
Paradisus Terrestris," appeared in London in 1629,
the most original book of botany of the period and
the most complete English treatise until Ray came.</p>

</div>

<p>Although published thirteen years after Shakespeare's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>death, Parkinson's book describes exactly the
style of gardens and the variety of flowers that were
familiar to Shakespeare; and to this book we may
go with confidence to learn more intimately the
aspect of what we may call the Shakespeare garden.
In it we learn to our surprise that horticulture in the
late Tudor and early Stuart days was not in the
simple state that it is generally supposed to have
been in. There were flower fanciers in and near
London&mdash;and indeed throughout England&mdash;and
there were expert gardeners and florists.</p>

<p>Parkinson was very friendly with the other London
flower growers of whom he speaks cordially in
his book and with never the least shadow of jealousy.
He frequently mentions visiting the gardens of
Gerard, Nicholas Leate, and Ralph Tuggy (or
Tuggie).</p>

<p>Everybody has heard of Gerard's "Herbal or
General Historie of Plants," published in 1597, for
it is one of the most famous ancient books on flowers.
A contemporary botanist said that "Gerard exceeded
most, if not all of his time, in his care, industry and
skill in raising, increasing, and preserving plants."
For twenty years Gerard was superintendent of
Lord Burleigh's famous gardens&mdash;one of which was
in the Strand, London, and the other at Theobald's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in Hertfordshire. Gerard also had a garden of his
own at Holborn (then a suburb of London), where
he raised many rare specimens and tried many experiments.
He employed a collector, William Marshall,
to travel in the Levant for new plants. Gerard
(1545-1607) was a physician, as well as a practical
gardener; but, although he possessed great knowledge,
he does not appear to have had the esthetic
appreciation of flowers that Parkinson had in such
great measure. His name is also written Gerade.
Gerard's "Herbal" was not the first. Horticulturists
could consult the "Grete Herbal," first
printed by Peter Treveris in 1516; Fitzherbert,
"Husbandry" (1523); Walter Cary, "Herbal"
(1525); a translation of Macer's "Herbal" (1530);
the "Herbal" by Dodoens, published in Antwerp
in 1544; William Turner's "The Names of Herbs
in Greke, Latin, Englishe, Duche and Frenche," etc.
(1548), reprinted by the English Dialect Society
(1881); Thomas Tusser's "Five Pointes of Good
Husbandry," etc. (1573), reprinted by the English
Dialect Society (1878); Didymus Mountain's
(Thomas Hill) "A Most Brief and Pleasant Treatise
Teaching How to Sow and Set a Garden"
(1563), "The Proffitable Art of Gardening"
(1568), and "The Gardener's Labyrinth" (1577);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Barnaby Googe's "Four Books of Husbandry," collected
by M. Conradus Heresbachius, "Newly Englished
and increased by Barnaby Googe" (1577);
William Lawson's "A New Orchard and Garden"
(1618); Francis Bacon's "Essay on Gardening"
(1625); and John Parkinson's "Paradisi in Sole,
Paradisus Terrestris" (1629).</p>

<p>Ralph Tuggie, or Tuggy, so often spoken of by
Parkinson, had a fine show garden at Westminster,
Where he specialized in carnations and gilliflowers.
After his death his widow, "Mistress Tuggie," kept
it up.</p>

<p>Another flower enthusiast was the Earl of Salisbury,
who placed his splendid garden at Hatfield
under the care of John Tradescant, the first of a
noted family of horticulturists. John Tradescant
also had a garden of his own in South Lambeth, "the
finest in England" every one called it. Here
Tradescant introduced the acacia; the lilac, called
in those days the "Blue Pipe Flower"; and, if we
may believe Parkinson, the pomegranate. Among
other novelties that attracted visitors to this show
garden he had the "Sable Flag," known also as the
"Marvel of Peru."</p>

<p>Lord Zouche was another horticulturist of note.
His fine garden at Hackney contained plants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he himself collected on his travels in Austria, Italy,
and Spain. Lord Zouche gave his garden into the
keeping of the distinguished Mathias de Lobel, a
famous physician and botanist of Antwerp and
Delft. Lobel was made botanist to James I and
had a great influence upon flower culture in England.
For him the Lobelia was named&mdash;an early instance
of naming plants for a person and breaking away
from the quaint descriptive names for flowers.</p>

<p>Elizabethan gardens owed much to Nicholas
Leate, or Lete, a London merchant who about 1590
became a member of the Levant Company. As a
leading merchant in the trade with Turkey and
discharging in connection with commercial enterprise
the duties of a semi-political character, Leate
became wealthy and was thus able to indulge his
taste for flowers and anything else he pleased. He
had a superb garden and employed collectors to hunt
for specimens in Turkey and Syria. His "servant at
Aleppo" sent many new flowers to London, such as
tulips, certain kinds of lilies,&mdash;the martagon, or
Turk's Cap, for instance,&mdash;irises, the Crown-Imperial,
and many new anemones, or windflowers.
The latter became the rage, foreshadowing the tulip-mania
of later years. Nicholas Leate also imported
the yellow Sops-in-Wine, a famous carnation from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Poland, which had never been heard of before in
England, and the beautiful double yellow rose from
Constantinople. Leate was a member of the Worshipful
Company of Ironmongers, London, and
Master of it in 1616, 1626, and 1627, and his portrait,
given here, said to be by Daniel Mytens,
hung in Ironmongers' Hall in London until this
famous building was destroyed by a German bomb
in 1917. Leate died in 1630.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus8">
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center half">NICHOLAS LEATE</p>
</div>

<p>Leate, being a most enthusiastic flower fancier and
garden lover, not only imported rare specimens but
tried many experiments. Indeed we are surprised
in going through old garden manuals of Shakespearean
days to see how many and how varied were
the attempts to produce "sports" and novelties. We
read of grafting a rosebush and placing musk in the
cleft in an effort to produce musk-roses; recipes for
changing the color of flowers; methods for producing
double flowers; and instructions for grafting and
pruning plants, sowing seeds, and plucking flowers
during the increase, or waning, of the moon.</p>

<p>These professional florists and gentlemen
amateurs valued their rare specimens from foreign
countries as they valued their emeralds from Peru,
Oriental pearls from Ceylon and rubies from India.
Parkinson says very earnestly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our English gardeners are all, or most of them,
ignorant in the ordering of their outlandish<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> flowers,
as not being trained to know them. And I do wish
all gentlemen and gentlewomen whom it may concern
for their own good, to be as careful whom they
trust with the planting and replanting of their fine
flowers as they would be with so many jewels; for
the roots of many of them, being small and of great
value, may soon be conveyed away and a clean, fair
tale told that such a root is rotten, or perished in the
ground, if none be seen where it should be; or else
that the flower hath changed in color when it had
been taken away, or a counterfeit one had been put
in the place thereof; and thus many have been deceived
of their daintiest flowers, without remedy or
knowledge of the defect."</p>

<p>The influence of the Italian Renaissance upon
the Elizabethan garden has already been shown
<a href="#Page_15">(see page 15)</a>, but the importance of this may be
appropriately recalled here in the following extract
from Bloom:</p>

<p>"The Wars of the Roses gave little time for gardening;
and when matters were settled and the educational
movements which marked the dawn of the
Renaissance began, the gardens once again, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
break of more than a thousand years, went back to
classical models, as interpreted by the Italian school
of the time. Thus the gardens of the Palace of
Nonesuch (1529) and Theobald's (1560) showed
all the new ideas: flower-beds edged with low trellises,
topiary work of cut box and yew, whereby the
natural growth of the trees was trained into figures
of birds and animals and especially of peacocks;
while here and there mounts were thrown up against
the orchard or garden wall, ascended by flights of
steps and crowned with arbors, while sometimes the
view obtained in this manner was deemed insufficient
and trellised galleries extended the whole
length of the garden. In 1573 the gardens of Kenilworth,
which Shakespeare almost certainly visited,
had a terrace walk twelve feet in width and raised
ten feet above the garden, terminating at either end
in arbors redolent with sweetbrier and flowers. Beneath
these again was a garden of an acre or more
in size divided into four quarters by sanded walks
and having in the center of each plot an obelisk of
red porphyry with a ball at the top. These were
planted with apple, pear and cherry while in the
center was a fountain of white marble."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IIa" id="IIa"></a>II<br />
<i>The Elizabethan Garden</i></h2></div>


<p>The Elizabethan garden was usually four-square,
bordered all around by hedges and intersected by
paths. There was an outer hedge that enclosed the
entire garden and this was a tall and thick hedge
made of privet, sweetbrier, and white thorn intermingled
with roses. Sometimes, however, this outer
hedge was of holly. Again some people preferred
to enclose their garden by a wall of brick or stone.
On the side facing the house the gate was placed.
In stately gardens the gate was of elaborately
wrought iron hung between stone or brick pillars on
the top of which stone vases, or urns, held brightly
blooming flowers and drooping vines. In simple
gardens the entrance was a plain wooden door,
painted and set into the wall or hedge like the quaint
little doors we see in England to-day and represented
in Kate Greenaway's pictures that show us how the
style persists even to the present time.</p>

<p>Stately gardens were usually approached from a
terrace running along the line of the house and commanding
a view of the garden, to which broad flights
of steps led. Thence extended the principal walks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
called "forthrights," in straight lines at right angles
to the terrace and intersected by other walks parallel
with the terrace. The lay-out of the garden, therefore,
corresponded with the ground-plan of the mansion.
The squares formed naturally by the intersection
of the "forthrights" and other walks were filled
with curious beds of geometrical patterns that were
known as "knots"; mazes, or labyrinths; orchards;
or plain grass-plots. Sometimes all of the spaces or
squares were devoted to "knots." These ornamental
flower-beds were edged with box, thrift, or thyme
and were surrounded with tiny walks made of gravel
or colored sand, walks arranged around the beds so
that the garden lovers might view the flowers at
close range and pick them easily.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in "Love's Labour's
Lost" Shakespeare speaks of "the curious knotted
garden." There are innumerable designs for these
"knots" in the old Elizabethan garden-books, representing
the simple squares, triangles, and rhomboids
as well as the most intricate scrolls, and complicated
interlacings of Renaissance design that resemble the
motives on carved furniture, designs for textiles and
ornamental leather-work (known as strap-work, or
<i>cuirs</i>). Yet these many hundreds of designs were
not sufficient, for the amateur as well as the profes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>sional
gardener often invented his own garden
"knots."</p>

<p>Where the inner paths intersected, a fountain or
a statue or some other ornament was frequently
placed. Sometimes, too, vases, or urns, of stone or
lead, were arranged about the garden in formal style
inspired by the taste of Italy. Sometimes, also,
large Oriental or stone jars were placed in conspicuous
spots, and these were not only intended for
decoration but served as receptacles for water.</p>

<p>There were four principles that were observed in
all stately Elizabethan gardens. The first was to
lay out the garden in accordance with the architecture
of the house in long terraces and paths of right
lines, or "forthrights," to harmonize with the
rectangular lines of the Tudor buildings, yet at the
same time to break up the monotony of the straight
lines with beds of intricate patterns, just as in the
case of architecture bay-windows, clustered and
twisted chimneys, intricate tracery, mullioned windows,
and ornamental gables relieved the straight
lines of the building.</p>

<p>The second principle was to plant the beds with
<i>mixed</i> flowers and to let the colors intermingle and
blend in such a way as to produce a mosaic of rich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
indeterminate color, ever new and ever varying as
the flowers of the different seasons succeeded each
other.</p>

<p>The third principle was to produce a garden of
flowers and shrubs for all seasons, even winter, that
would tempt the owner to take pleasure and exercise
there, where he might find recreation, literally
re-creation of mind and body, and become freshened
in spirit and renewed in health.</p>

<p>The fourth principle was to produce a garden
that would give delight to the sense of smell as well
as to the sense of vision&mdash;an idea no longer sought
for by gardeners.</p>

<p>Hence it was just as important, and infinitely
more subtle, to mingle the perfumes of flowers while
growing so that the air would be deliciously scented
by a combination of harmonizing odors as to mingle
the perfumes of flowers plucked for a nosegay, or
Tussie-mussie, as the Elizabethans sometimes
quaintly called it.</p>

<p>Like all cultivated Elizabethans, Shakespeare appreciated
the delicious fragrance of flowers blooming
in the garden when the soft breeze is stirring their
leaves and petals. There was but one thing to which
this subtle perfume might be compared and that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
ethereal and mysterious music. For example, the
elegant Duke in "Twelfth Night," reclining on his
divan and listening to music, commands:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That strain again! It had a dying fall.</span><br />
<span class="i0">O it came o'er my ear like the sweet south</span><br />
<span class="i0">That breathes upon a bank of violets</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stealing and giving odor.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Bacon also associated the scent of delicate
flowers with music. He writes: "And because the
breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air (whence
it comes and goes like the warbling of music) than
in the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for delight
than to know what be the flowers and plants
that do best perfume the air. Roses, damask, and
red, are fast flowers of their smells, so that you may
walk by a whole row of them and find nothing of
their sweetness, yea though it be in a morning's dew.
Bays, likewise, yield no smell as they grow, rosemary
little, nor sweet marjoram. That which above
all others yields the sweetest smell in the air is the
violet, especially the white double violet, which
comes twice a year&mdash;about the middle of April and
about Bartholomew-tide. Next to that is the musk-rose,
then the strawberry leaves dying, which yield
a most excellent cordial smell, then the flower of
the vines, it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>which grows upon the cluster in the first coming
forth; then sweetbrier, then wall-flowers, which are
very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower
chamber window; then pinks and gilliflowers; then
the flowers of the lime-tree; then the honeysuckles,
so they be somewhat afar off; of bean flowers, I
speak not, because they are field flowers. But those
which perfume the air most delightfully not passed
by as the rest but being trodden upon and crushed
are three: burnet, wild thyme and water-mints.
Therefore, you are to set whole alleys of them to
have the pleasure when you walk or tread."</p>

</a>
<p class="caption center half">THE KNOT-GARDEN, NEW PLACE, STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</p>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare very nearly follows Bacon's order
of perfume values in his selection of flowers to adorn
the beautiful spot in the wood where <i>Titania</i> sleeps.
<i>Oberon</i> describes it:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fairies were thought to be particularly fond of
thyme; and it is for this reason that Shakespeare
carpeted the bank with this sweet herb. Moreover,
as we have just seen, Bacon tells us that thyme is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
one of those plants which are particularly delightful
if trodden upon and crushed. Shakespeare accordingly
knew that the pressure of the Fairy Queen's
little body upon the thyme would cause it to yield a
delicious perfume.</p>

<p>The Elizabethans, much more sensitive to perfume
than we are to-day, appreciated the scent of
what we consider lowly flowers. They did not hesitate
to place a sprig of rosemary in a nosegay of
choice flowers. They loved thyme, lavender,
marjoram, mints, balm, and camomile, thinking that
these herbs refreshed the head, stimulated the
memory, and were antidotes against the plague.</p>

<p>The flowers in the "knots" were perennials,
planted so as to gain uniformity of height; and those
that had affinity for one another were placed side
by side. No attempt was made to group them; and
no attempt was made to get <i>masses</i> of separate color,
what Locker-Lampson calls "a mist of blue in the
beds, a blaze of red in the celadon jars" and what
we try for to-day. On the contrary, the Elizabethan
gardener's idea was to mix and blend the flowers
into a combination of varied hues that melted into
one another as the hues of a rainbow blend and in
such a way that at a distance no one could possibly
tell what flowers produced this effect. This must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
have required much study on the part of the gardeners,
who kept pace with the seasons and always
had their beds in bloom. Sir Henry Wotton, Ambassador
to Venice in the reign of James I, and
author of the "Elements of Architecture," but far
better known by his lovely verse to Elizabeth of
Bohemia beginning, "You meaner beauties of the
night," was an ardent flower lover. He was greatly
impressed by what he called "a delicate curiosity
in the way of color":</p>

<p>"Namely in the Garden of Sir Henry Fanshaw
at his seat in Ware Park, where I well remember he
did so precisely examine the <i>tinctures</i> and <i>seasons</i>
of his <i>flowers</i> that in their <i>settings</i>, the <i>inwardest</i>
of which that were to come up at the same time,
should be always a little <i>darker</i> than the <i>outmost</i>,
and so serve them for a kind of gentle <i>shadow</i>, like
a piece not of <i>Nature</i> but of <i>Art</i>."</p>

<p>Browne also gives a splendid idea of the color
effect of the garden beds of this period:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">As in a rainbow's many color'd hue,</span><br />

<p>By the side of the showy and stately flowers,
as well as in kitchen gardens, were grown the
"herbs of grace" for culinary purposes and the
medicinal herbs for "drams of poison." Rosemary&mdash;"the
cheerful Rosemary," Spenser calls it&mdash;was
trained over arbors and permitted to run over
mounds and banks as it pleased. Sir Thomas More
allowed it to run all over his garden because the
bees loved it and because it was the herb sacred to
remembrance and friendship.</p>

<p>In every garden the arbor was conspicuous. Sometimes
it was a handsome little pavilion or summer-house;
sometimes it was set into the hedge; sometimes
it was cut out of the hedge in fantastic topiary
work; sometimes it was made of lattice work; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
sometimes it was formed of upright or horizontal
poles, over which roses, honeysuckle, or clematis
(named also Lady's Bower because of this use) were
trained. Whatever the framework was, plain or
ornate, mattered but little; it was the creeper that
counted, the trailing vines that gave character to
the arbor, that gave delight to those who sought the
arbor to rest during their stroll through the gardens,
or to indulge in a pleasant chat, or delightful flirtation.

<p>A beautiful method of obtaining shady walks was
to make a kind of continuous arbor or arcade of
trees, trellises, and vines. This arcade was called
poetically the "pleached alley."<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For the trees,
willows, limes (lindens), and maples were used, and
the vines were eglantine and other roses, honeysuckle
(woodbine), clematis, rosemary, and grapevines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_6" id="Footnote_5_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <i>Pleaching</i> means trimming the small branches and foliage of
trees, or bushes, to bring them to a regular shape. Certain trees
only are submissive to this treatment&mdash;holly, box, yew privet,
whitethorn, hornbeam, linden, etc., to make arbors, hedges, bowers,
colonnades and all cut-work.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Plashing</i> is the half-cutting, or dividing of the quick growth
almost to the outward bark and then laying it orderly in a slope
manner as you see a cunning hedger lay a dead hedge and then
with the smaller and more pliant branches to wreath and bind
in the tops." Markham, "The County Farm" (London, 1616).</p></div>

<p>Another feature of the garden was the maze, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
labyrinth. It was a favorite diversion for a visitor
to puzzle his way through the green walls, breast
high, to the center; and the owner took delight in
watching the mistakes of his friend and was always
ready to give him the clue. When James I on his
"Southern Progress" in 1603 visited the magnificent
garden known as Theobald's and belonging to Lord
Burleigh, where we have already seen<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Gerard was
the horticulturist, the King went into the labyrinth
of the garden "where he re-created himself in the
meanders compact of bays, rosemary and the like,
overshadowing his walk."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_7" id="Footnote_6_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> <a href="#Page_33">Page 33.</a></p></div>

<p>The labyrinth, or maze, was a fad of the day. It
still exists in many English gardens that date from
Elizabethan times and is a feature of many more
recent gardens. Perhaps of all mazes the one at
Hampton Court Palace is the most famous.</p>

<p>The orchard was another feature of the Elizabethan
garden. It was the custom for gentlemen
to retire after dinner (which took place at eleven
o'clock in the morning) to the garden arbor, or
to the orchard, to partake of the "banquet" or
dessert. Thus <i>Shallow</i> addressing <i>Falstaff</i> after
dinner exclaims:</p>

<p>"Nay, you shall see mine orchard, where, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
arbor, we will eat a last year's pippin of my own
grafting with a dish of carraways and so forth."<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The uses of the Elizabethan garden were many:
to walk in, to sit in, to dream in. Here the courtier,
poet, merchant, or country squire found refreshment
for his mind and recreation for his body. The garden
was also intended to supply flowers for nosegays,
house decoration, and the decoration of the
church. Sweet-smelling herbs and rushes were
strewn upon the floor as we know by <i>Grumio's</i> order
for <i>Petruchio's</i> homecoming in "The Taming of the
Shrew." One of Queen Elizabeth's Maids of
Honor had a fixed salary for keeping fresh flowers
always in readiness. The office of "herb-strewer to
her Majesty the Queen" was continued as late as
1713, through the reign of Anne and almost into
that of George I.</p>

<p>The houses were very fragrant with flowers in
pots and vases as well as with the rushes on the floor.
Flowers were therefore very important features in
house decoration. A Dutch traveler, Dr. Leminius,
who visited England in 1560, was much struck by
this and wrote:</p>

<p>"Their chambers and parlors strewed over with
sweet herbs refreshed me; their nosegays finely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>termingled
with sundry sorts of fragrant flowers in
their bed-chambers and private rooms with comfortable
smell cheered me up and entirely delighted all
my senses."</p>

<p>We have only to look at contemporary portraits
to see how essential flowers were in daily life. For
instance, Holbein's "George Gisze," a London merchant,
painted in 1523, has a vase of choice carnations
beside him on the table filled with scales,
weights, and business paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan lady was just as learned in the
medicinal properties of flowers and herbs as her
Medieval ancestor. She regarded her garden as a
place of delight and at the same time as of the
greatest importance in the economic management
of the household.</p>

<p>"The housewife was the great ally of the doctor:
in her still-room the lady with the ruff and farthingale
was ever busy with the preparation of cordials,
cooling waters, conserves of roses, spirits of herbs
and juleps for calentures and fevers. All the herbs
and flowers of the field and garden passed through
her fair white hands. Poppy-water was good for
weak stomachs; mint and rue-water was efficacious
for the head and brain; and even walnuts yielded
a cordial. Then there was cinnamon water and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
essence of cloves, gilliflower and lemon water, sweet
marjoram water and the spirit of ambergris.</p>

<p>"These were the Elizabethan lady's severer toils,
besides acres of tapestry she had always on hand.
Her more playful hours were devoted to the manufacture
of casselettes, month pastilles, sweet waters,
odoriferant balls and scented gums for her husband's
pipe (God bless her!) and there were balsams and
electuaries for him to take to camp, if he were a
soldier fighting in Ireland or in the Low Countries,
and wound-drinks if he was a companion of
Frobisher and bound against the Spaniard, or the
Indian pearl-diver of the Pacific. She had a specific
which was of exceeding virtue in all swooning of
the head, decaying of the spirits, also in all pains
and numbness of joints and coming of cold.</p>

<p>"That wonderful still-room contains not only
dried herbs and drugs, but gums, spices, ambergris,
storax and cedar-bark, civet and dried flowers and
roots. In that bowl angelica, carduus benedictus
(Holy Thistle), betony, juniper-berries and wormwood
are steeping to make a cordial-water for the
young son about to travel; and yonder is oil of
cloves, oil of nutmegs, oil of cinnamon, sugar, ambergris
and musk, all mingling to form a quart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
liquor as sweet as hypocras. Those scents and spices
are for perfumed balls to be worn round the ladies'
necks, there to move up and down to the music of
sighs and heart-beating, envied by lovers whose letters
will perhaps be perfumed by their contact.</p>

<p>"What pleasant bright London gardens we dream
of when we find that the remedy for a burning fever
is honeysuckle leaves steeped in water, and that a
cooling drink is composed of wood sorrel and Roman
sorrel bruised and mixed with orange juice and
barley-water. Mint is good for colic; conserves of
roses for the tickling rheum; plaintain for flux;
vervain for liver-complaint&mdash;all sound pleasanter
than those strong biting minerals which now kill or
cure and give nature no time to heal us in her own
quiet way."<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Bacon's "Essay on Gardening" is very detailed
and very practical, and it must be remembered that
he was addressing highly cultivated and skilfully
trained amateurs and professional gardeners when
he wrote:</p>

<p>"God almighty first planted a garden; and indeed
it is the purest of human pleasures; it is the greatest
refreshment to the spirit of man. And a man shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegancy
men come to build stately sooner than to garden
finely, as if gardening were the greater perfection."</p>

<p>The Elizabethan Age, with its superlatively cultivated
men and women, was certainly one of those
ages of civility and elegancy of which Bacon speaks.
The houses were stately and the gardens perfection,
affording appropriate setting for the brilliant courtiers
and accomplished ladies of both Tudor and
early Stuart times.</p>

<p>We sometimes hear it said that Francis Bacon's
garden was his <i>ideal</i> of what a garden should be
and that his garden was never realized. This, however,
is not the case. Old prints are numerous of
gardens of wealthy persons in the reign of Elizabeth
and James I. Then, too, we have Sir William
Temple's description of Moor Park, and "this garden,"
says Horace Walpole, "seems to have been
made after the plan laid down by Lord Bacon in
his Forty-sixth Essay."</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus10">

</a>
<p class="caption center half">TYPICAL GARDEN OF SHAKESPEARE'S TIME&mdash;CRISPIN DE PASSE (1614)</p>
</div>

<p>Sir William's account is as follows:</p>

<p>"The perfectest figure of a garden I ever saw,
either at home or abroad, was that of Moor Park in
Hertfordshire, when I knew it about thirty years
ago. It was made by the Countess of Bedford,
esteemed among the perfectest wits of her time and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>celebrated by Dr. Donne; and with very great care,
excellent contrivance and much cost.</p>

<p>"Because I take the garden I have named to have
been in all kinds the most beautiful and perfect, at
least in the figure and disposition, that I have ever
seen, I will describe it for a model to those that meet
with such a situation and are above the regards of
common expense.</p>

<p>"It lies on the side of a hill, upon which the house
stands, but not very steep. The length of the house,
where the best rooms and of most use or pleasure
are, lies upon the breadth of the garden; the great
parlor opens into the middle of a terrace gravel walk
that lies even with it, and which may lie, as I remember,
about three hundred paces long and broad
in proportion; the border set with standard laurels
and at large distances, which have the beauty of
orange-trees out of flower and fruit. From this walk
are three descents by many stone steps, in the middle
and at each end, into a very large parterre. This
is divided into quarters by gravel walks and
adorned with two fountains and eight statues in
the several quarters. At the end of a terrace walk
are two summer-houses, and the sides of the parterre
are ranged with two large cloisters open to the
garden, upon arches of stone, and ending with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
other summer-houses even with the cloisters, which
are paved with stone, and designed for walks of
shade, there being none other in the whole parterre.
Over these two cloisters are two terraces covered
with lead and fenced with balustrades; and the
passage into these airy walks is out of the two summer-houses
at the end of the first terrace walk. The
cloister facing the south is covered with vines and
would have been proper for an orange-house, and
the other for myrtles or other more common greens,
and had, I doubt not, been cast for that purpose, if
this piece of gardening had been then in as much
vogue as it is now.</p>

<p>"From the middle of this parterre is a descent by
many steps flying on each side of a grotto that lies
between them, covered with lead and flat, into the
lower garden, which is all fruit-trees ranged about
the several quarters of a wilderness which is very
shady; the walks here are all green, the grotto embellished
with figures of shell rock-work, fountains
and water-works. If the hill had not ended with the
lower garden, and the wall were not bounded by a
common way that goes through the park, they might
have added a third quarter of all greens; but this
want is supplied by a garden on the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the house, which is all of that sort, very wild, shady,
and adorned with rough rock work and fountains."</p>

<p>To write of Elizabethan gardens without giving
Bacon's beautifully worked out theories would be
like performing "Hamlet" without the character of
<i>Hamlet</i>. Bacon's Essay is too long to quote in its
entirety, but the specific instructions are as follows:</p>

<p>"For gardens (speaking of those which are indeed
prince-like), the contents ought not well to
be under thirty acres of ground; and to be divided
into three parts: a green in the entrance; a heath or
desert in the going forth; and the main garden in
the midst, besides alleys on both sides. And I like
well that four acres of ground be assigned to the
green, six to the heath, four and a half to either
side and twelve to the main garden. The green hath
two pleasures: the one because nothing is more
pleasant to the eye than green grass kept finely
shorn; the other because it will give you a fair alley
in the midst, by which you may go in front upon
a stately hedge, which is to enclose this garden.
But because the alley will be long, and in great heat
of the year or day, you ought not to buy the shade
in the garden by going in the sun through the green;
therefore, you are of either side the green to plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a covert alley upon carpenter's work, about twelve
foot in height, by which you may go in shade into
the garden.</p>

<p>"The garden is best to be square, encompassed
on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge.
The arches to be upon pillars of carpenter's work,
of some ten foot high and six foot broad, and the
spaces between of the same dimension with the
breadth of the arch; over the arches let there be an
entire hedge of some four foot high, framed also
upon carpenter's work; and upon the upper hedge,
over every arch, a little turret with a belly, enough
to receive a cage of birds; and over every space,
between the arches, some other little figure, with
broad plates of round colored glass, gilt, for the
sun to play upon. But this hedge I intend to be
raised upon a bank, not steep, but gentle slope, of
some six foot, set all with flowers. Also I understand
that this square of the garden should not be
the whole breadth of the ground, but to leave on
either side ground enough for diversity of side alleys,
into which the two covert alleys of the green may
deliver you. But there must be no alleys with
hedges at either end of this great enclosure.</p>

<p>"For the main garden I do not deny there should
be some fair alleys, ranged on both sides with fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>-trees,
and arbors with seats set in some decent order;
but these to be by no means set too thick, but to
leave the main garden so as it be not close, but the
air open and free. For, as for shade, I would have
you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds, there
to walk, if you be disposed, in the heat of the year,
or day, but to make account that the main garden is
for the more temperate parts of the year and in the
heat of the summer for the morning and the evening,
or overcast days.</p>

<p>"For the side grounds you are to fill them with
variety of alleys, private, to give a full shade, some
of them wheresoever the sun be. You are to frame
some of them likewise for shelter, that when the
wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery.
And these alleys must be, likewise, hedged at both
ends to keep out the wind, and these closer alleys
must be ever finely graveled and no grass, because of
going wet. In many of these alleys, likewise, you
are to set fruit-trees of all sorts, as well upon the
walls as in ranges. And this would be generally
observed that the borders wherein you plant your
fruit-trees be fair and large and low (and not steep)
and set with fine flowers, but thin and sparingly
lest they deceive the trees. At the end of both the
side grounds I would have a mount of some pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
height, leaving the wall of the enclosure breast high,
to look abroad into the fields.</p>

<p>"For the heath, which was the third part of our
plot, I wish it to be framed, as much as may be, to
a natural wildness. Trees, I would have none in it;
but some thickets made only of sweetbrier and
honeysuckle and some wild vine amongst; and the
ground set with violets, strawberries and primroses;
for these are sweet and prosper in the shade; and
these to be in the heath, here and there, not in any
order. I also like little heaps in the nature of molehills
(such as are in wild heaths) to be set, some
with wild thyme, some with pinks, some with
germander that gives a good flower to the eye; some
with periwinkle, some with violets, some with strawberries,
some with cowslips, some with daisies, some
with red roses, some with <i>lilium convallium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> some
with sweet williams, red, some with bear's foot<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
the like low flowers, being withal sweet and sightly.
Part of which heaps to be with standards of little
bushes pricked upon their top and put without. The
standards to be roses, juniper, holly, barberries (but
here and there, because of the smell of their blossom),
red currants, gooseberries, rosemary, bays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sweetbrier and the like. But these standards to be
kept with cutting that they grow not out of course.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_11" id="Footnote_10_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> <i>Auricula.</i></p></div>

<p>"For the ordering of the ground within the great
hedge, I leave it to variety of device; advising,
nevertheless, that whatsoever form you cast it into,
first it be not too busy or full of work. Wherein
I, for my part, do not like images cut out in juniper,
or other garden stuff&mdash;they be for children. Little
low hedges, round like welts, with some pretty pyramids,
I like well, and in some places fair columns
upon frames of carpenter's work. I would also have
the alleys spacious and fair. You may have closer
alleys upon the side grounds, but none in the main
garden. I wish also in the very middle a fair mount
with three ascents and alleys, enough for four to
walk abreast, which I would have to be perfect
circles without any bulwarks or embossments, and
the whole mount to be thirty foot high; and some
fine banqueting-house with some chimneys neatly
cast and without too much glass.</p>

<p>"As for the making of knots, or figures, with divers
colored earths that they may lie under the windows
of the house, on that side which the garden stands,
they be but toys. You may see as good sights many
times in tarts."</p>

<p>Fountains Bacon considered "a great beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
refreshment," but he did not care for pools, nor did
he favor aviaries "unless they were large enough to
have living plants and bushes set in them and supply
natural nesting for the birds."</p>

<p>We have already seen that Bacon was very choice
regarding "the flowers that best perfume the air";
and he felt it was very essential that people should
know what to plant for the different seasons. So
he tells us:</p>

<p>"There ought to be gardens for all months of the
year, in which, severally, things of beauty may be
in season. For December and January and the latter
part of November, you must take such things as
are green all winter: holly, ivy, bays, juniper,
cypress-trees, yew, pine, apple-trees, fir-trees, rosemary,
lavender, periwinkle, the white, the purple,
and the blue; germander, flags; orange-trees, lemon-trees
and myrtle, if they be stoved; and sweet
marjoram warm set. There followeth for the latter
part of January and February, the mezerion tree
which then blossoms; crocus vernus, both the yellow
and the gray; primroses, anemones, the early
tulip, hyacinthus orientalis, <i>chamaires fritellaria</i>.
For March there come violets, especially the single
blue, which are the earliest, the yellow daffodil, the
daisy, the almond-tree in blossom, the peach-tree in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>blossom, the cornelian tree in blossom, sweetbrier.
In April follow the double white violet, the wallflower,
the stock gilliflower, the cowslip, flower-de-luces,
and lilies of all natures, rosemary flowers,
the tulip, the double peony, the pale daffodil, the
French honeysuckle, the cherry-tree in blossom, the
damson and plum-trees in blossom, the white thorn

of all sorts, roses of all kinds except the musk, which
comes later, honeysuckles, strawberries, bugloss,
columbine, the French marigold (<i>Flos Africanus</i>),
cherry-tree in fruit, ribes, figs in fruit, rasps, vine-flowers,
lavender in flowers, the sweet satyrian, with

nectarines, cornelians, wardens, quinces. In October
and the beginning of November come services,
medlars, bullaces, roses cut, or removed to come late,
hollyhocks and such like. These particulars are for
the climate of London; but my meaning is perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

<p>Gardening was a serious business. The duties
of gardeners were not light. We are told that
"Gardeners should not only be diligent and painful,
but also experienced and skilful; at the least, one of
them to have seen the fine gardens about London
and in Kent; to be able to cast out the Quarters of
the garden as may be most convenient that the
Walks and the Alleys be long and large; to cast
up Mounts, to tread out Knots in the Quarters of
arms and fine devices, to set and sow in them sweet-smelling
flowers and strewing herbs; to have in the
finest parts of the garden Artichokes, Pompions,
Melons, Cucumbers and such-like; in other places
convenient Radishes, Keritts, Carrats and other
roots with store of all kind of herbs for the Kitchen
and Apothecary; to know what Flowers and Herbs
will best endure the Sun and which need most to be
shaded: in like sort, for the East and North winds,
not only to be skilful in planting and grafting of
all kinds of fruit-trees, but also how to place them
in best order; and to be able to judge of the best
times and seasons to plant and graft all fruits and
to set and sow all flowers, herbs and roots; and
also the best time when to cut and gather all herbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and seeds and fruits, and in what sort to keep and
preserve them; to make fair Bowling Alleys well
banked and sealed, which, being well kept, in many
houses are very profitable to the gardeners."</p>

<p>The instructions in the Elizabethan manuals for
grafting, pleaching, and plashing <a href="#Page_50">(see page 50)</a> are
most explicit and elaborate. There are rules for the
care of every flower and herb. Nothing is too small
for attention, The old authors even say what flowers
should be picked often and what flowers prefer to
be let alone. One old gardener gives the following
details with regard to the sowing of seeds:</p>

<p>"If you will [he writes], you may sow your seeds
in rows, or trails, either round about the edges of
your beds to keep them in fashion, and plant either
herbs or flowers in the body of your beds, or you
may furnish your beds all over, making three, four,
or five rows, or trails, according to the bigness of
your bed; the order, or manner, is to make each trail
of like distance and range your line and by it, either
with your finger or a small stick, to make your trail
about an inch thick, or thereabout; and therein to
sow your seed, not over-thick. If you put your
seeds in a white paper, you may (if the seeds are
small) very easily and equally sow them by shaking
the lower end of your paper with the forefinger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
that hand you sow with. The paper must not be
much open at the end. Then with your hand, or a
trowel, to smooth the earth into each trail."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IIIa" id="IIIa"></a>III<br />
<i>Old Garden Authors</i></h2></div>


<p>The books from which both professional and
amateur gardeners gained their instruction are full
of delightful information, and to us are quaintly
expressed. Many of them were standard authorities
for several generations and went through various
editions, which, as time went on, were touched
up by a more recent authority. One of these well-known
garden authors was Thomas Hill, who wrote
under the peculiar name of Didymus Mountain; another
was Gervase Markham whose "Country
Farm," published in London in 1616 (the year of
Shakespeare's death), often passes for an original
work. "The Country Farm," however, was an
earlier book, and a French one at that, called "La
Maison Rustique," published in Paris in 1600 by
Charles Stevens and John Liébault, "doctors of
physicke." This was translated into English very
soon after its appearance by Richard Surflet and
published under the title of "The Country Farm."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
It became an extremely popular book before Gervase
Markham took hold of it. Markham became a great
authority on all garden topics and wrote and
adapted many books on the subject. From his edition
of "The Country Farm" we learn that</p>

<p>"It is a commendable and seemly thing to behold
out at a window many acres of ground well-tilled
and husbanded; but yet it is much more to behold
fair and comely proportions, handsome and pleasant
arbors, and, as it were, closets, delightful borders
of lavender, rosemary, box and other such-like;
to hear the ravishing music of an infinite number
of pretty, small birds, which continually, day
and night, do chatter and chant their proper and
natural branch-songs upon the hedges and trees of
the garden; and to smell so sweet a nosegay so near
at hand, seeing that this so fragrant a smell cannot
but refresh the lord of the farm exceedingly when
going out of his bedchamber in the morning after
sunrise; and while as yet the clear and pearl-like
dew doth perch on to the grass he giveth himself to
hear the melodious music of the bees which do fill
the air with a most acceptable sweet and pleasant
harmony.</p>

<p>"Now for the general proportion of gardens.
They may at your pleasure carry any of these four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
shapes: that is to say, either square, round, oval, or
diamond. This is but the outward proportion, or
the verge and girdle of your garden. As for the inward
proportions and shapes of the Quarters, Beds,
Banks, Mounts and such-like, they are to be divided
by Alleys, Hedges, Borders, Rails, Pillars and such-like;
and by these you may draw your garden unto
what form you please, not respecting whatsoever
shape the outward verge carrieth. For you may
make that garden which is square without to be
round within, and that which is round, either square,
or oval; that which is oval, either of the former,
and that which is diamond any shape at all,&mdash;and
yet all exceedingly comely. You may also, if your
ground be naturally so situated, or if your industry
please so to bring it to pass, make your garden rise
and mount by several degrees, one level ascending
above another, in such sort as if you had divers gardens
one above another, which is exceedingly beautiful
to the eye and very beneficial to your flowers and
fruit-trees, especially if such ascents have the benefit
of the Sun rising upon them; and thus, if you please,
you may have in one level a square plot; in another,
a round; in a third a diamond; and in a fourth, an
oval; then amongst the ascending banks, which are
on either side the stairs, you mount into your several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
gardens, you shall make your physic garden or places
to plant your physic herbs."</p>

<p>We also learn from "The Country Farm" that</p>

<p>"The Garden of Pleasure shall be set about and
compassed with arbors made of jessamin, rosemarie,
box, juniper, cypress-trees, savin, cedars, rose-trees
and other dainties first planted and pruned according
as the nature of every one doth require, but after
brought into some form and order with willow or
juniper poles, such as may serve for the making of
arbors. The ways and alleys must be covered and
sown with fine sand well beat, or with the powder
of the sawing of marble, or else paved handsomely
with good pit stone.</p>

<p>"This garden, by means of a large path of the
breadth of six feet, shall be divided into two equal
parts; the one shall contain the herbs and flowers
used to make nosegays and garlands of, as March
violets, Provence gilliflowers, purple gilliflowers, Indian
gilliflowers, small pansies, daisies, yellow and
white gilliflowers, marigolds, lily connally,<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> daffodils,
Canterbury bells, purple velvet flowers, anemones,
corn-flag,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> mugwort, lilies and other such-like;
and it may be indeed the Nosegay Garden.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_12" id="Footnote_11_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Lily-of-the-valley.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_13" id="Footnote_12_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Gladiolus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p></div>

<p>"The other part shall have all other sweet-smelling
herbs whether they be such as bear no flowers, or,
if they bear any, yet they are not put in nosegays
alone, but the whole herb be with them, as Southernwood,
wormwood, pellitory, rosemary, jessamine,
marierom, balm-mints, pennyroyal, costmarie,
hyssop, lavender, basil, sage, savory, rue, tansy,
thyme, camomile, mugwort, bastard marierum,
nept, sweet balm, all-good, anis, horehound and
others such-like; and this may be called the garden
for herbs and good smell.</p>

<p>"These sweet herbs and flowers for nosegays shall
be set in order upon beds and quarters of such-like
length and breadth as those of the kitchen garden;
others in mazes made for the pleasing and recreating
of the sight, and other some are set in proportions
made of beds interlaced and drawn one within another
or broken off with borders, or without borders."</p>

<p>This arrangement is interesting as not only showing
the division of flower-beds but that certain herbs
were used in nosegays. It did not, therefore, strike
Shakespeare's audiences as strange that <i>Perdita</i>
offered to her guests rosemary and rue on an equality
with marigolds, violets, the crown-imperial (then
so rare), daffodils, and lilies of all kinds.</p>

<p class="caption center half">THE KNOT-GARDEN, NEW PLACE, STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</p>
</div>

<p>In William Lawson's "A New Orchard and Garden,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>which also appeared about the time of Shakespeare's
death, the gardens of the period are perfectly
described. Lawson was a practical gardener
and had a poetic appreciation of flowers and trees.
His book was long an authority. Every one had it.
Lawson writes quaintly and delightfully:</p>

<p>"The Rose, red, damask, velvet and double-double,
Provence rose, the sweet musk Rose double
and single, the double and single white Rose, the
fair and sweet-scenting Woodbine double and single
and double-double, purple Cowslips and double-double
Cowslips, Primrose double and single, the
Violet nothing behind the best for smelling sweetly
and a thousand more will provoke your content.</p>

<p>"And all these by the skill of your gardener, so
comely and orderly placed in your borders and
squares and so intermingled that none looking thereon
cannot but wonder to see what Nature corrected
by Art can do.</p>

<p>"When you behold in divers corners of your
Orchard Mounts of stone, or wood, curiously
wrought within and without, or of earth covered
with fruit-trees: Kentish cherry, damsons, plums,
etc., with stairs of precious workmanship; and in
some corner a true Dial or Clock and some antique
works and especially silver-sounding music&mdash;mixt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Instruments and Voices&mdash;gracing all the rest&mdash;how
will you be rapt with delight!</p>

<p>"Large walks, broad and long, close and open,
like the Tempe groves in Thessaly, raised with
gravel and sand, having seats and banks of Camomile,&mdash;all
this delights the mind and brings health
to the body. Your borders on every side hanging
and drooping with Raspberries, Barberries and Currants
and the roots of your trees powdered with
strawberries&mdash;red, white and green,&mdash;what a pleasure
is this!</p>

<p>"Your gardener can frame your lesser wood
(shrubs) to the shape of men armed in the field
ready to give battle, or swift-running greyhounds,
or of well-scented and true running hounds to chase
the deer or hunt the hare. This kind of hunting
shall not waste your corn nor much your coin.</p>

<p>"Mazes, well formed, a man's height, may, perhaps,
make your friend wander in gathering of
berries till he cannot recover himself without your
help.</p>

<p>"To have occasion to exercise within your
Orchard, it shall be a pleasure to have a Bowling-Alley.</p>

<p>"Rosemary and sweet Eglantine are seemly ornaments
about a door, or window; so is Woodbine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"One chief grace that adorns an Orchard I cannot
let slip. A brood of nightingales, who with their
several notes and tunes with a strong, delightsome
voice out of a weak body, will bear you company,
night and day. She will help you cleanse your trees
of caterpillars and all noisome worms and flies. The
gentle Robin Redbreast will help her and in Winter
in the coldest storms will keep a part. Neither will
the silly Wren be behind in summer with her distinct
whistle (like a sweet Recorder)<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to cheer your
spirits. The Blackbird and Throstle (for I take it
the Thrush sings not but devours) sing loudly on a
May morning and delight the ear much (and you
need not want their company if you have ripe Cherries
or Berries) and would gladly, as the rest, do you
pleasure. But I had rather want their company than
my fruit.</p>

<p>"What shall I say? A thousand of delights are
in an Orchard."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_14" id="Footnote_13_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A kind of flute. See "Hamlet"; Act II, Scene II.</p></div>

<p>Parkinson endeavors in the kindliest way to help
the amateur. He is genuinely desirous to encourage
gardening and offers his knowledge and experience
with bounteous generosity. He has no preference
regarding site. He says:</p>

<p>"According to the situations of men's dwellings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
so are the situations of their gardens. And, although
divers do diversely prefer their own several places
which they have chosen, or wherein they dwell; as
some those places that are near unto a river or brook
to be best for the pleasantness of the water, the ease
of transportation of themselves, their friends and
goods, as also for the fertility of the soil, which is
seldom near unto a river's side; and others extol the
side or top of an hill, be it small or great, for the
prospect's sake. And again, some the plain or champian
ground for the even level thereof. Yet to show
you for every of these situations which is the fittest
place to plant your garden in and how to defend
it from the injuries of the cold winds and frosts that
may annoy it, I hope be well accepted.</p>

<p>"To prescribe one form for every man to follow
were too great presumption and folly; for every man
will please his own fancy, be it orbicular or round,
triangular or three-square, quadrangular or four-square,
or more long than broad. Let every man
choose which him liketh best. The four-square form
is the most usually accepted with all and doth best
agree to any man's dwelling. To form it therefore
with walks cross the middle both ways and round
about it also with hedges, knots or trayles, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
other work within the four-square parts is according
to every man's conceit. For there may be therein
walls either open or close, either public or private,
a maze or wilderness, a rock or mount with a fountain
in the midst to convey water to every part of
the garden either in pipes under the ground, or
brought by hand and emptied into large cisterns or
great Turkey jars placed in convenient places.
Arbors also being both graceful and necessary may
be appointed in such convenient places as the corners,
or elsewhere, as may be most fit to serve both
for shadow and rest after walking.</p>

<p>"To border the whole square to serve as a hedge
thereunto everyone taketh what liketh him best, as
either privet alone, or sweetbriar and whitethorn
enlaced together and roses of one, or two, or more
sorts, placed here and there amongst them. Some
also take lavender, rosemary, sage, southernwood,
lavender-cotton, or some such thing. Some again
plant Cornell trees and plash them, or keep them low
to form into a hedge. And some again take a low
prickly shrub that abideth always green called in
Latin <i>Pyracantha</i>, which in time will make an evergreen
hedging, or border, and when it beareth fruit,
which are red berries like unto hawthorn berries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
make a glorious show among the green leaves in
winter time when no other shrubs have fruit, or
leaves."</p>

<p>For the borders of the knots, Parkinson recommends
thrift, hyssop and germander, but "chiefly
above all herbs the small low, or dwarf French or
Dutch box, because it is evergreen, thick and easily
cut and formed."</p>

<p>Roses, he says, should be planted in "the outer
borders of the quarters, or in the middle of the long
beds"; and lilies should be placed in a "small, round
or square in a knot without any tall flowers growing
about them."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IVa" id="IVa"></a>IV<br />
<i>"Outlandish" and English Flowers</i></h2></div>


<p>The flowers for the knots, or beds, Parkinson divides
into two classes: the "Outlandish flowers" and
the "English flowers."</p>

<p>Of the outlandish flowers first of all he mentions
daffodils, of which there were "almost a hundred
sorts, some either white, or yellow, or mixed, or
else being small or great, single or double, and some
having but one flower on a stalk; others, many."
Other daffodils were so exceedingly sweet that a
very few were sufficient to perfume a whole cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ber:
the "single English Bastard daffodil, which
groweth wild in many woods, groves and orchards
in England; the double English Bastard, the French
single white, the French double yellow, the Spanish
yellow Bastard, the great or little Spanish white,
and the Turkie single white Daffodil" are some of
the varieties Parkinson mentions. Then of the
<i>Fritillaria</i> or the "checkerd Daffodil" Parkinson
gives "half a score, several sorts, both white and
red, both yellow and black, which are a wonderful
grace and ornament in a garden in regard of the
checker-like spots in the flower."</p>

<p>Hyacinths in Parkinson's book are about "half a
hundred sorts: some like unto little bells or stars,
others like unto little bottles or pearls, both white
and blue, sky colored and blush, and some star-like
of many pretty various forms and all to give delight
to them that will be curious to observe them."</p>

<p>Shakespeare does not mention hyacinths.</p>

<p>Of crocus, or saffron flowers, there were twenty
sorts, some flowering in the spring, others in the
autumn, but all of "glorious beauty."</p>

<p>Of lilies there were "twenty several sorts and
colors," among which the Crown Imperial, "for her
stately form deserveth some special place in the
garden, as also the Martagons, both white and red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
both blush and yellow, that require to be set by
themselves apart."</p>

<p>Tulips (which are never mentioned by Shakespeare)
were so many and various that Parkinson
considered it beyond his ability to describe them all
"for there is such a wonderful variety and mixture
of colors that it is almost impossible for the wit of
man to decipher them and to give names," and he
added that "for every one that he might name ten
others would probably spring up somewhere" and
"besides this glory of variety in colors that these
flowers have, they carry so stately and delightful a
form and do abide so long in their bravery, there is
no lady or gentlewoman of any worth that is not
caught with this delight, or not delighted with these
flowers."</p>

<p>Then the anemones, or windflowers, "so full of
variety, so dainty, so pleasant and so delightsome,
so plentiful in bearing and durable," he tells us
were great favorites.</p>

</a>
<p class="caption center half">BORDER, NEW PLACE, STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</p>
</div>

<p>Then the bear's-ears,<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or French cowslips, each
one "seeming to be a nosegay of itself alone" and
of so many colors as "white, yellow, blush, purple,
red, tawny, murray, hair color and so on" and "not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>unfurnished with a pretty sweet scent, which doth
add an increase of pleasure in those that make them
an ornament for wearing."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_15" id="Footnote_14_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> <i>Auriculas.</i></p></div>

<p>Flower-de-luces also of many sorts, one kind
"being the Orris roots that are sold at the Apothecaries
whereof sweet powders are made to lie among
garments" and "the greater Flag kind frequent
enough in this land" and which "well doth serve
to deck up both garden and house with Nature's
beauties."</p>

<p>Chief of all was "Your Sable Flower, so fit for
a mourning habit that I think in the whole compass
of Nature's store there is not a more pathetical."</p>

<p>The hepatica, or noble liverwort, white, red, blue,
or purple, somewhat resembling violets; the
cyclamen, or sow-bread, a "flower of rare receipt
with flowers like unto red, or blush-colored violets
and leaves having no small delight in their pleasant
color, being spotted and circled white upon green";
the <i>Leucoinum</i>, or bulbous violet; <i>Muscari</i>, or musk
grape flower; star-flowers of different sorts; <i>Phalangium</i>,
or spiderwort; winter crowfoot, or wolfsbane;
the Christmas flower, "like unto a single white
rose"; bell-flowers of many kinds; yellow larkspur,<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
"the prettiest flower of a score in the garden"; flower
gentle, or Floramour; Flower-of-the-Sun;<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the Marvel
of Peru, or of the World; double marsh marigold,
or double yellow buttons; double French marigolds;
and the double red <i>Ranunculus</i>, or crowfoot,
"for exceeding the most glorious double anemone,"
completes Parkinson's list for flowers to be planted
in the beds. The jasmine, white and yellow; the
double honeysuckle and the lady's-bower (clematis),
both white, and red and purple, single and double
are "the fittest of Outlandish plants to set by arbors
and banqueting-houses<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that are open both before
and above, to help to cover them and to give sight,
smell and delight."</p>

It was a simple summer-house, or arbor, to which
people repaired after dinner to eat the dessert, then called "banquet."</p></div>

<p>Parkinson has not quite finished, however, with
the outlandish flowers for he calls attention to the
cherry bay, or <i>Laurocerasus</i>, saying that "the Rose
Bay, or Oleander, and the white and blue Syringa,
or Pipe Tree,<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are all graceful and delightful to
set at several distances in the borders of knots, for
some of them give beautiful and sweet flowers."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_19" id="Footnote_18_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Lilac-tree.</p></div>

<p>Furthermore Parkinson writes that "the Pyra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>cantha,
or Prickly Coral Tree, doth remain with
green leaves all the year and may be plashed, or
laid down, or tyed to make up a fine hedge to border
the whole knot" and that "the Dwarf Bay, or
Mezereon, is most commonly either placed in the
middle of a knot, or at the corners thereof, and
sometimes all along a walk for the more grace."</p>

<p>So much for the "outlandish" flowers!</p>

<p>Turning now to the "English flowers," we find
that Parkinson includes primroses and cowslips,
single rose campions, white, red, and blush and the
double red campion and the Flower of Bristow, or
Nonesuch, "a kind of Campion, white and blush as
well as orange-color." And here Parkinson stops a
moment to talk about this Nonesuch, for he was so
fond of it that he holds it in his hand in the portrait
that appears as a frontispiece to his "Paradisus" and
from which our reproduction is made. Of it he
writes: "The orange color Nonesuch with double
flowers as is rare and not common so for his bravery
doth well deserve a Master of account that will take
care to keep and preserve it."</p>

<p>Then he continues: Bachelors'-buttons, both
white and red; wall-flowers, double and single;
stock-gilliflowers, queen's gilliflowers (which some
call dame's violets and some winter gilliflowers, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
kind of stock-gilliflower); violets, "the spring's
chief flowers for beauty, smell and use," both single
and double; snap-dragons, "flowers of much more
delight"; columbines, "single and double, of many
sorts, fashions and colors, very variable, both
speckled and parti-colored&mdash;no garden would willingly
be without them." Next "Larks' heels, or
spurs, or toes, as they are called, single and double";
pansies, or heartsease, of divers colors, "although
without scent yet not without some respect and delight";
double poppies "adorning a garden with
their variable colors to the delight of the beholders";
double daisies, "white and red, blush and speckled
and parti-colored, besides that which is called Jack-an-Apes-on-Horseback,"
double marigolds; French
marigolds "that have a strong, heady scent, both
single and double, whose glorious show for color
would cause any to believe there were some rare
goodness or virtue in them; and carnations and gilliflowers."</p>

<p>Here again Parkinson's enthusiasm causes him to
pause, for he exclaims:</p>

<p>"But what shall I say to the Queen of Delight
and of Flowers, Carnations and Gilliflowers, whose
bravery, variety and sweet smell joined together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
tieth every one's affection with great earnestness
both to like and to have them?"</p>

<p>Of the overwhelming number he singles out the
red and gray Hulo, the old carnation, the Grand
Père; the Cambersive, the Savadge, the Chrystal, the
Prince, the white carnation or delicate, the ground
carnation, the French carnation, the Dover, the Oxford,
the Bristow, the Westminster, the Daintie, the
Granado, and the orange tawny gilliflower and its
derivatives, the Infanta, the striped tawny, the
speckled tawny, the flaked tawny, the Grifeld
tawny, and many others.</p>

<p>Many sweet pinks are included, "all very sweet
coming near the Gilliflowers, Sweet Williams and
Sweet Johns," both single and double, red and
spotted, "and a kind of wild pinks, which for their
beauty and grace help to furnish a garden." Then,
too, we have peonies, double and single; hollyhocks,
single and double; and roses.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan gardens, therefore, presented a
magnificent array of flowers; and it was not only in
the grand gardens of castles and manor-houses, but
in the estates of London merchants along the Strand
and of the florists in Holborn, Westminster, and
elsewhere that fine flower shows were to be enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
during every month of the year. In the country
before the simple dwellings and the half-timbered
and thatched cottages bright flowers blossomed in
the same beauty and profusion as to-day.</p>

<p>The charming cottage garden has changed little.</p>

<p>Finally, in summing up, if we imagine as a background
a group of Tudor buildings in the Perpendicular
style of architecture of red brick broken with
bay-windows and groups of quaint chimneys variously
ornamented with zigzag and other curious
lines, gables here and there&mdash;the whole façade rising
above a terrace with broad flights of steps&mdash;one at
the middle and one at each end&mdash;and from the terrace
"forthrights" and paths intersecting and in
the squares formed by them bright beds of flowers
so arranged that the colors intermingle and blend
so as to produce the effect of a rich mosaic and
redolent with the sweetest perfumes all mingled
with particular and peculiar care and art, we shall
have a mental picture of the kind of garden that
lay before <i>Olivia's</i> house in "Twelfth Night," where
<i>Malvolio</i> parades up and down the "forthrights,"
as Shakespeare distinctly tells us, in his yellow
cross-garters, to pick up the letter dropped on the
path by <i>Maria</i> while the rollicking <i>Sir Toby Belch</i>,
witless <i>Sir Andrew Aguecheek</i>, and merry <i>Maria</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
watch his antics from their hiding-place in the box-tree,
or hedge.</p>

<p>Such also was the garden at Belmont, <i>Portia's</i>
stately home, in which <i>Lorenzo</i> and <i>Jessica</i>, while
waiting for their mistress on that moonlight night
"when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and
they did make no noise," voiced their ravishing duet,
"On Such a Night."</p>

<p>Such also was the garden into which <i>Romeo</i>
leaped over the high wall to sing before <i>Juliet's</i>
window a song that in her opinion was far sweeter
than that of the nightingale that nightly sang in
the pomegranate-tree by her balcony.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we wish to visualize
<i>Perdita's</i> garden&mdash;that of a simple shepherdess&mdash;we
must imagine a tiny cottage enclosure gay and
bright with blooms of many hues, arranged in simple
beds neatly bordered with box or thrift, but where
there are no terraces, forthrights, or ornamental
vases, urns or fountains. This little cottage garden
is the kind that brightened the approach to Anne
Hathaway's house at Shottery and Shakespeare's
own dwelling at Stratford.</p>

<p>This is a descendant, as we have seen, of the
little Garden of Delight, the Pleasance of the
Medieval castle. The simple cottage garden is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
easier of the two to reproduce to-day. Although it
only occupies a small corner in the garden proper,
yet <i>all</i> the flowers mentioned by Shakespeare can
be grown in it.</p>

<p>In rural England it is not rare to come across
old gardens that owed their existence to disciples
of Didymus Mountain, Markham, Lawson, and
Parkinson&mdash;gardens that have been tended for three
hundred years and more with loving care, where
the blossoms are descendants of "outlandish" importations
of Nicholas Leate and Lord Burleigh,
and of simple English flowers. These gladden the
eyes of their owners to-day as the original flowers
gladdened the eyes of those who planted them.
Generations of people in the house and generations
of flowers in the garden thus flourished and faded
side by side while the old stock put forth new blossoms
in both house and garden to continue the family
traditions of both the human and the floral world.</p>

<p>A typical garden dating from Shakespearean times
was thus described a few years ago in "The Gentleman's
Magazine":</p>

<p>"In all England one could, perhaps, find no
lovelier garden than that of T&mdash;&mdash;, an old manor-house,
sheltered by hill and bounded by the moat,
which is the only relic of the former feudal castle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>The tiled roof, the gables inlaid with oaken beams,
are almost hidden by fragrant roses and jasmine
flowers that shine like stars against their darker
foliage. A sun-dial stands in the square of lawn
before the porch, and the windows to your right open
upon a yew-hedged bowling-green. Beyond, the
smooth lawn slopes down to a little stream, thick
with water-loving reeds and yellow flags; and lime-trees,
whose fragrance the breeze wafts to us, sweep
the greensward in magnificent curves. If you turn
to the left, along yonder grassy path you will find
yourself between borders gorgeous with poppies and
sweet william and hollyhocks and lilies that frame
distances of blue hills and clear sky.</p>

<p>"The kitchen-garden lies through that gate in
the wall of mellowed brick&mdash;an old-fashioned
kitchen-garden, with mingled fruit and vegetables
and flowers. There are pear and plum-trees against
the wall and strawberry beds next the feathery
asparagus and gooseberry bushes hidden by hedges
of sweet peas. Another turn will bring you into a
labyrinth of yew hedges and so back to the bowling-green,
across which the long shadows lie, and the
sun-dial which marks the approach of evening. The
light is golden on the house and on the tangled borders;
the air is fragrant with many scents."</p>

<h2><a name="Ib" id="Ib"></a>I<br />
<i>Primroses, Cowslips, and Oxlips</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2">PRIMROSE (<i>Primula vulgaris</i>). English
poets have always regarded the primrose as
the first flower of spring&mdash;the true <i>Flor di
prima vera</i>. This name calls to mind Botticelli's
enchanting <i>Primevera</i> that hangs in the Uffizi, in
which the sward is dotted with spring flowers that
seem to have burst into blossom beneath the footsteps
of Venus and her three Graces&mdash;those lovely
ladies of the Italian Renaissance, clad in light, fluttering
draperies. This decorative picture expresses
not only the joy and beauty of newly-awakened
spring, but something much deeper, something that
the painter did not realize himself; and this was
what the Italian Renaissance was destined to mean
to all the world: a New Birth of beauty in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
arts and a new era of human sympathy for mankind.</p>

<p>Sandro Botticelli, whom we may appropriately
call <i>Flor di prima vera</i> among painters, was as unaware
of his mission in art as the primroses that
come into being at the call of a new day of spring
sunshine from a long dark winter's sleep in a soil
of frozen stiffness. Something of the tender and
wistful beauty of early spring&mdash;her faint dreams
and soft twilights, her languid afternoons and her
veiled nights, when pale stars tremble through gray
mists and when warm rains softly kiss the drowsy
earth&mdash;Botticelli has put into his enchanting spring
idyl; and this same wistful, half-drowsy, and
evanescent beauty is characteristic of the primrose.</p>

<p>is a perfect and sympathetic description of the flower
in "The Two Noble Kinsmen."<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Observe that the bells of the primrose are "dim"&mdash;pale
in hue&mdash;because the earth is not sufficiently
awake for bright colors or for joyful chimes&mdash;so
the color is faint and the sound is delicate. Trees
are now timidly putting forth tender leaves, buds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
peer cautiously from the soil, and few birds sing;
for leaves, buds, and birds know full well that winter
is lurking in the distance and that rough winds
occasionally issue from the bag of Boreas. The
time has not yet come for "lisp of leaves and ripple
of rain" and for choirs of feathered songsters. Yet
all the more, because of its bold daring and its
modest demeanor, the primrose deserves the enthusiastic
welcome it has always received from poets
and flower lovers.</p>

<p>"The primrose," writes Dr. Forbes Watson,
"seems the very flower of delicacy and refinement;
not that it shrinks from our notice, for few plants are
more easily seen, coming as it does when there is a
dearth of flowers, when the first birds are singing
and the first bees humming and the earliest green
putting forth in the March and April woods. And
it is one of those plants which dislikes to be looking
cheerless, but keeps up a smouldering fire of blossom
from the very opening of the year, if the weather
will permit.</p>

<p>"The flower is of a most unusual color, a pale,
delicate yellow, slightly tinged with green. And the
better flowers impress us by a peculiar paleness, not
dependent upon any feebleness of hue, which we
always find unpleasing, but rather upon the <i>exquisite</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<i>softness of their tone</i>. And we must not overlook
the little round stigma, that green and translucent
gem, which forms the pupil of the eye, and is surrounded
by a deeper circle of orange which helps it
to shine forth more clearly. Many flowers have a
somewhat pensive look; but in the pensiveness of
the primrose there is a shade of melancholy&mdash;a
melancholy which awakens no thought of sadness
and does but give interest to the pale, sweet, inquiring
faces which the plant upturns towards us.</p>

<p>"In the primrose, as a whole, we cannot help
being struck by an exceeding softness and delicacy;
there is nothing sharp, strong, or incisive; the smell
is 'the faintest and most ethereal perfume,' as Mrs.
Stowe has called it in her 'Sunny Memories,' though
she was mistaken in saying that it disappears when
we pluck the flower. It is meant to impress us as
altogether soft and yielding. One of the most beautiful
points in the primrose is the manner in which
<i>the paleness of the flowers is taken up by the herbage</i>.
This paleness seems to hang about the plant like a
mystery, for though the leaves of the primrose may
at times show a trace of the steady paleness of the
cowslip, it is more usually confined to their undersurfaces
and the white flower-stalks with their clothing
of down. And when we are looking at the primrose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>one or other of these downy, changeful portions
is continually coming into view, so that we get a
feeling as if there hung about the whole plant a
clothing of soft, evanescent mist, thickening about
the center of the plant and the undersurfaces of the
leaves which are less exposed to the sun. And then
we reach one of the main expressions of the primrose.
When we look at the pale, sweet flowers, and
the soft-toned green of the herbage, softened further
here and there by that uncertain mist of down, the
dryness of the leaf and fur enters forcibly into our
impression of the plant, giving a sense of extreme
delicacy and need of shelter, as if it were some
gentle creature which shrinks from exposure to the
weather."</p>

<p>The Greeks associated the idea of melancholy
with this flower. They had a story of a handsome
youth, son of Flora and Priapus, whose betrothed
bride died. His grief was so excessive that he died,
too, and the gods than changed his body into a primrose.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time, the primrose was also associated
with early death; and it is one of the flowers
thrown upon the corse of <i>Fidele</i>, whose lovely, wistful
face is compared to the "pale primrose." Thus
<i>Arviragus</i> exclaims as he gazes on the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
youth, <i>Fidele</i>, the assumed name of <i>Imogen</i> in disguise:</p>

<p>The English primrose is one of a large family
of more than fifty species, represented by the primrose,
the cowslip, and the oxlip. All members of
this family are noted for their simple beauty and
their peculiar charm.</p>

<p>Parkinson writes:</p>

<p>"We have so great variety of Primroses and
Cowslips in our country breeding that strangers,
being much delighted with them, have often furnished
into divers countries to their good content.</p>

<p>"All Primroses bear their long and large, broad
yellowish-green leaves without stalks most usually,
and all the Cowslips have small stalks under the
leaves, which are smaller and of a darker green. The
name of <i>Primula veris</i>, or Primrose, is indifferently
conferred on those that I distinguish for <i>Paralyses</i>,
or Cowslips. All these plants are called most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
usually in Latin <i>Primulæ veris</i>, <i>Primulæ pretenses</i>
and <i>Primulæ silvarum</i>, because they shew by their
flowering the new Spring to be coming on, they
being, as it were, the first Embassadors thereof.
They have also divers other names, as <i>Herba Paralysis</i>,
<i>Arthritica</i>, <i>Herba Sancti Petri</i>, <i>Claues Sancti
Petri</i>, <i>Verbasculum odoratum</i>, <i>Lunaria arthritica</i>,
<i>Phlomis</i>, <i>Alisma silvarum</i> and <i>Alismatis alterum
genus</i>. Some have distinguished them by calling
the Cowslips <i>Primula Veris Elatior</i>, that is the
Taller Primrose, and the other <i>Humilis</i>, Low, or
Dwarf, Primrose.</p>

<p>"Primroses and Cowslips are in a manner wholly
used in Cephalicall diseases to ease pains in the
head. They are profitable both for the Palsy and
pains of the joints, even as the Bears' Ears<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> are,
which hath caused the names of <i>Arthritica Paralysis</i>
and <i>Paralytica</i> to be given them."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_24" id="Footnote_23_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Auriculas.</p></div>

<p>Tusser in his "Husbandry" includes the primrose
among the seeds and herbs of the kitchen; and
Lyte says that "the cowslips, primroses and oxlips
are now used daily amongst other pot-herbs, but in
physic there is no great account made of them."
"The old name was Primerolles," Dr. Prior notes
in his quaint book on flowers. "Primerole as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
outlandish, unintelligible word was soon familiarized
into Primerolles and this into Primrose." The
name was also written primrolles and finally settled
down into primrose. Chaucer wrote primerole, a
name derived from the French <i>Primeverole</i>, meaning,
like the Italian <i>Flor di prima vera</i>, the first
spring flower.</p>

<p><span class="lb">COWSLIP</span> (<i>Paralysis vulgaris pratensis</i>). The
cowslip is an ingratiating little flower, not so aloof
as its cousin the primrose, and not at all melancholy.
In the popular lore of Shakespeare's time the cowslip
was associated with fairies. In many places it
was known as "fairy cups." For this reason Shakespeare
makes <i>Ariel</i> lie in a cowslip's bell when the
fay is frightened by the hooting of owls, or tired of
swinging merrily in "the blossom that hangs on the
bough." One of the duties of <i>Titania's</i> little maid
of honor was "to hang a pearl in every cowslip's
ear"; and this gay little fairy informs <i>Puck</i> of the
important place cowslips hold in the court of the
tiny <i>Queen Titania</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p></div>

<p>To appreciate the meaning of this comparison, it
must be remembered that the "pensioners" of Queen
Elizabeth's court were a guard of the tallest and
handsomest men to be found in the whole kingdom,
men, moreover, who were in the pride of youth, and
scions of the most distinguished families. Their
dress was of extraordinary elegance and enriched
heavily with gold embroidery. Hence, "gold coats"
for the cowslips. Here and there jewels sparkled
and glistened on the pensioners' coats. Hence
rubies&mdash;fairy favors&mdash;favors from the Queen! The
pensioners also wore pearls in their ears, like Raleigh
and Leicester and other noblemen. Hence the fairy
had to "hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear." An
idea, too, of the size of <i>Titania</i> and her elves is given
when the cowslips are considered "tall," and tall
enough to be the body-guard of <i>Queen Titania</i>.
This was a pretty little allusion to Queen Elizabeth
and her court, which the audience that gathered to
see the first representation of "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" did not fail to catch.</p>

<p>Most sympathetically did Dr. Forbes Watson,
when lying on a bed of fatal illness, put into words
what many persons have felt regarding this flower:</p>

<p>"Few of our wild flowers give intenser pleasure
than the cowslip, yet perhaps there is scarcely any
whose peculiar beauty depends so much upon locality
and surroundings. There is a homely simplicity
about the cowslip, much like that of the daisy,
though more pensive,&mdash;the quiet, sober look of an
unpretending country girl, not strikingly beautiful
in feature or attire, but clean and fresh as if new
bathed in milk and carrying us away to thoughts of
daisies, flocks and pasturage and the manners of a
simple, primitive time, some golden age of shepherd-life
long since gone by. And more; in looking at
the cowslip we are always most forcibly struck by
its apparent wholesomeness and health. This wholesomeness
is quite unmistakable. It belongs even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the smell so widely different from the often oppressive
perfume of other plants, as lilies, narcissuses,
or violets. Now just such a healthy milk-fed look,
just such a sweet, healthy odor is what we find in
cows&mdash;an odor which breathes around them as they
sit at rest in the pasture. The 'lips,' of course, is
but a general resemblance to the shape of the petals
and suggests the source of the fragrance. The cowslip,
as we have said, is a singularly healthy-looking
plant, indeed, nothing about it is more remarkable.
It has none of the delicacy and timidity of the primrose.
All its characters are well and healthily pronounced.
The paleness is uniform, steady, and
rather impresses us as whiteness; and the yellow of
the cup is as rich as gold. The odor is not faint, but
saccharine and luscious. It does not shrink into the
sheltered covert, but courts the free air and sunshine
of the open fields; and instead of its flowers
peeping timidly from behind surrounding leaves, it
raises them boldly on a stout, sufficient stalk, the
most conspicuous object in the meadow. Its poetry
is the poetry of common life, but of the most delicious
common life that can exist. The plant is in
some respects careless to the verge of disorder; and
you should note that carelessness well, till you feel
the force of it, as especially in the lame imperfec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>tion
of the flower buds, only, perhaps half of them
well developed and the rest dangling all of unequal
lengths. Essentially the cowslip and the primrose
are only the same plant in two different forms, the
one being convertible into the other. The primrose
is the cowslip of the woods and sheltered lanes; the
cowslip is the primrose of the fields."</p>

<p>The name cowslip is not derived from the lips
of the cow, but, according to Skeat, the great Anglo-Saxon
authority, it comes from an Anglo-Saxon word
meaning dung and was given to the plant because
it springs up in meadows where cows are pastured.</p>

<p>"The common field Cowslip," says Parkinson,
"I might well forbear to set down, being so plentiful
in the fields; but because many take delight in
it and plant it in their gardens, I will give you the
description of it here. It hath divers green leaves,
very like unto the wild Primrose, but shorter,
rounder, stiffer, rougher, more crumpled about the
edges and of a sadder green color, every one standing
upon his stalk which is an inch or two long.
Among the leaves rise up divers long stalks, a foot
or more high, bearing at the top many fair, yellow,
single flowers with spots of a deep yellow at the
bottom of each leaf, smelling very sweet.</p>

<p>"In England they have divers names according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to several countries, as Primroses, Cowslips, Oxlips,
Palsieworts and Petty Mullins. The Frantic Fantastic,
or Foolish, Cowslip in some places is called
by country people Jack-an-Apes-on-Horseback,
which is a usual name given by them to many other
plants, as Daisies, Marigolds, etc., if they be strange
or fantastical, differing in form from the ordinary
kind of the single ones. The smallest are usually
called through all the North Country Birds' Eyen,
because of the small yellow circle in the bottoms of
the flowers resembling the eye of a bird."</p>

<p><span class="lb">OXLIP</span> (<i>Primula eliator</i>). The oxlip combines
the qualities of primrose and cowslip. "These two
plants," writes a botanist, "appear as divergent expressions
of a simple type, the cowslip being a contracted
form of primrose, the sulphur yellow and
the fine tawny, watery rays of the latter brightened
into well defined orange spots. In the oxlip these
characters anastomose."</p>

<p>Thus, partaking of the character of primrose and
cowslip, the oxlip is considered by some authorities
a hybrid. "The oxlip and the polyanthus," says
Dr. Forbes Watson, "with its tortoiseshell blossoms,
are two of the immediate forms; the polyanthus
being a great triumph of the gardener's art, a delightful
flower, quite a new creation and originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
produced by cultivation of the primrose." In England
the oxlip is found in woods, fields, meadows,
and under hedges. Though a spring flower it lingers
into summer and is found in company with the nodding
violet, wild thyme, and luscious eglantine on
the bank where <i>Titania</i> loved to sleep lulled to rest
by song.<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <i>Perdita</i> speaks of "bold oxlips" ("The
Winter's Tale," Act iv, Scene iii); and compared
With the primrose and cowslip the flower deserves
the adjective.</p>

<p>"Oxlips in their cradles growing," in the song in
"The Two Noble Kinsmen,"<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which Shakespeare
wrote with John Fletcher, shows great knowledge
of the plant, for the root-leaves of the oxlip are
shaped like a cradle.</p>

<p>Parkinson writes: "Those are usually called oxlips
whose flowers are naked, or bare, without husks
to contain them, being not so sweet as the cowslip,
yet have they some little scent, although the Latin
name doth make them to have none."</p>

<p>Is the opening verse that <i>Autolycus</i> sings so gaily
in "The Winter's Tale."<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The daffodil was "carefully
nourished up" in Elizabethan gardens, as the
saying went. Before Shakespeare's time a great
number of daffodils had been introduced into England
from various parts of the Continent. Gerard
describes twenty-four different species, "all and
every one of them in great abundance in our London
gardens."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_31" id="Footnote_30_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Act IV, Scene II.</p></div>

<p>There were many varieties both rare and ordinary.
Parkinson particularly distinguishes the true
daffodils, or <i>narcissus</i>, from the "Bastard Daffodils,"
or <i>pseudo narcissus</i>; and he gives their differences
as follows:</p>

<p>"It consisteth only in the flower and chiefly in
the middle cup, or chalice; for that we do, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
manner only, account those to be <i>Pseudo Narcissus</i>,
Bastard Daffodils, whose middle cup is altogether as
long, and sometimes a little longer than, the outer
leaves that do encompass it, so that it seemeth rather
like a trunk, or a long nose, than a cup or chalice,
such as almost all the <i>Narcissi</i>, or true Daffodils,
have. Of the Bastard tribe Parkinson gives the
great yellow Spanish Daffodil; the Mountain Bastard
of divers kinds; the early straw-colored; the
great white Spanish; the greatest Spanish white; the
two lesser White Spanish; our common English wild
Bastard Daffodil; the six-cornered; the great double
yellow, or John Tradescant's great Rose Daffodil;
Mr. Wilmer's great double Daffodil; the great
double yellow Spanish, or Parkinson's Daffodil; the
great double French Bastard; the double English
Bastard, or Gerard's double Daffodil; the great
white Bastard Rush Daffodil, or Junquilia; the
greater yellow Junquilia; and many others."</p>

<p>Then he adds:</p>

<p>"The <i>Pseudo narcissus Angliens vulgaris</i> is so
common in all England, both in copses, woods and
orchards, that I might well forbear the description
thereof. It hath three, or four, grayish leaves, long
and somewhat narrow, among which riseth up the
stalk about a span high, or little higher, bearing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the top, out of a skinny husk (as all other Daffodils
have), one flower, somewhat large, having the six
leaves that stand like wings, of a pale yellow color,
and the long trunk in the middle of a faire yellow
with the edges, or brims, a little crumpled, or uneven.
After the flower is past, it beareth a round
head, seeming three square, containing round black
seed."</p>

<p>Shakespeare knew all of these varieties very well
and had many of them in mind when he wrote the
beautiful lines for <i>Perdita</i>, who exclaims:</p>

<p>Much has been written about this description of
the daffodils; and it is generally thought that "to
take the winds of March with beauty" means to
charm, or captivate, the wild winds with their loveliness.
I do not agree with this idea, and venture
to suggest that as the daffodils sway and swing in
the boisterous March winds with such infinite grace
and beauty, bending this way and that, they "take
the winds with beauty," just as a graceful dancer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
is said to take the rhythmic steps of the dance with
charming manner.</p>

<p>We get a hint for this also in Wordsworth's poem:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wandered lonely as a cloud</span><br />
<span class="i21">That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</span><br />

<p>No one can read this poem without feeling that
the dancing daffodils "take the winds of March with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>beauty." The very name of the daffodil touches
our imagination. It carries us to the Elysian Fields,
for the ancient Greeks pictured the meads of the
blessed as beautifully golden and deliciously fragrant
with asphodels. The changes ring through
asphodel, affodile, affodyl, finally reaching daffodil.
Then there is one more quaint and familiar name
and personification,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>The idea of daffodil as a rustic maiden was popular
in folk-lore and poetry. The feeling is so well expressed
in Michael Drayton's sprightly eclogue
called "Daffodil" that it forms a natural complement
to the happy song of care-free <i>Autolycus</i> just
quoted. This Pastoral captured popular fancy; and
it is just as fresh and buoyant as it was when it was
written three hundred years ago. Two shepherds,
<i>Batte</i> and <i>Gorbo</i>, meet:</p>

<p>The flower was also called jonquil, saffron lily,
Lent lily and narcissus. It was the large yellow
narcissus, known as the Rose of Sharon, so common
in Palestine, of which Mohammed said: "He that
hath two cakes of bread, let him sell one of them
for a flower of the narcissus; for bread is the food
of the body, but narcissus is the food of the soul."</p>

<p>Narcissus, the most beautiful youth of B&oelig;otia,
was told that he would live happily until he saw his
own face. Loved by the nymphs, and particularly
Echo, he rejected their advances for he was immune
to love and admiration. One day, however, he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>held

<p>Because the flower was consecrated to Ceres and
to the Underworld and to the Elysian Fields, the
daffodil was one of the flowers that Proserpine was
gathering when "dusky Dis" carried her off&mdash;and
the myth also hints that the Earth purposely brought
the asphodel forth from the Underworld to entice
the unsuspecting daughter of Ceres. Sophocles associates
the daffodil with the garlands of great goddesses:
"And ever, day by day, the narcissus with
its beauteous clusters, the ancient coronet of the
mighty goddesses, bursts into bloom by heaven's
dew."<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The delightful Dr. Forbes Watson writes of the
daffodil like a painter, with accurate observation and
bright palette:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the daffodil the leaves and stems are of a full
glaucous green, a color not only cool and refreshing
in itself, but strongly suggestive of water, the most
apparent source of freshness and constituting a most
delicious groundwork for the bright, lively yellow
of the blossoms. Now what sort of spathe would be
likely to contribute best to this remarkable effect of
the flower? Should the colors be unusually striking
or the size increased, or what? Strange to say, in
both Daffodil and Pheasant's Eye (Poet's Narcissus)
we find the spathe dry and withered, shrivelled
up like a bit of thin brown paper and clinging round
the base of the flowers. We cannot overlook it, and
most assuredly we were never meant to do so. Nothing
could have been more beautifully ordered than
this contrast, there being just sufficient to make us
appreciate more fully that abounding freshness of
life.</p>

<p>"It is a plant which affords a most beautiful contrast,
a cool, watery sheet of leaves with bright,
warm flowers, yellow and orange, dancing over the
leaves like meteors over a marsh. The leaves look
full of watery sap, which is the life blood of plants
and prime source of all their freshness, just as the
tissues of a healthy child look plump and rosy from
the warm blood circulating within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"In its general expression the Poet's Narcissus
seems a type of maiden purity and beauty, yet
warmed by a love-breathing fragrance; and yet what
innocence in the large soft eye which few can rival
among the whole tribe of flowers. The narrow, yet
vivid fringe of red so clearly seen amidst the whiteness
suggests again the idea of purity and gushing
passion&mdash;purity with a heart which can kindle into
fire."</p>

<p><span class="lb">DAISY</span> (<i>Bellis perennis</i>). Shakespeare often

<p>The botanical name <i>Bellis</i> shows the origin of the
flower. Belides, a beautiful Dryad, trying to escape
the pursuit of Vertumnus, god of gardens and
orchards, prayed to the gods for help; and they
changed her into the tiny flower. In allusion to this

<p>The daisy was under the care of Venus. It has
been beloved by English poets ever since Chaucer
sang the praises of the day's eye&mdash;daisy. Chaucer
tells us, in what is perhaps the most worshipful poem
ever addressed to a flower, that he always rose early
and went out to the fields, or meadows, to pay his
devotions to this "flower of flowers," whose praises
he intended to sing while ever his life lasted, and
he bemoaned the fact, moreover, that he had not
words at his command to do it proper reverence.</p>

<p>The English daisy is "The wee, modest crimson-tipped
flower," as Burns has described it, and must
not be confused with the daisy that powders the
fields and meadows in our Southern States with a
snow of white blossoms supported on tall stems.
This daisy, called sometimes the moon-daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum
Leucanthemum</i>), is known in England
as the midsummer daisy and ox-eye. In France it is
called marguerite and paquerette. Being a midsummer
flower, it is dedicated to St. John the Baptist.
It is also associated with St. Margaret and
Mary Magdalen, and from the latter it derives the
names of maudlin and maudelyne. As <i>Ophelia</i>
drowned herself in midsummer the daisies that are
described in her wreath are most probably marguerites
and not the "day's eye" of Chaucer.</p>

<p>Parkinson does not separate daisies very particularly.
"They are usually called in Latin," he tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
us, "<i>Bellides</i> and in English Daisies. Some of them
<i>Herba Margarita</i> and <i>Primula veris</i>, as is likely
after the Italian names of Marguerita and <i>Flor di
prima vera gentile</i>. The French call them
<i>Paquerettes</i> and <i>Marguerites</i>; and the fruitful sort,
or those that have small flowers about the middle
one, <i>Margueritons</i>. Our English women call them
Jack-an-Apes-on-Horseback."</p>

<p>The daisy that an Elizabethan poet quaintly describes
as a Tudor princess resembles the midsummer
daisy rather than the "wee, modest, crimson-tipped
flower" of Burns:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">About her neck she wears a rich wrought ruff</span><br />
<span class="i0">With double sets most brave and broad bespread</span><br />
<span class="i0">Resembling lovely lawn, or cambric stuff</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pinned up and prickt upon her yellow head.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Also Browne in his "Pastorals" seems to be thinking
of this flower:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Daisy scattered on each mead and down,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A golden tuft within a silver crown.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="lb">VIOLET</span> (<i>Viola odorata</i>). The violet was considered
"a choice flower of delight" in English gardens.
Shakespeare speaks of the violet on many
occasions and always with tenderness and deep appreciation
of its qualities. Violets are among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
flowers that the frightened Proserpine dropped from
Pluto's ebon car&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i3">Violets dim</span><br />

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus in Shakespeare's opinion the violet out-sweetened
both Juno, majestic queen of heaven, and
Venus, goddess of love and beauty.</p>

<p>How could he praise the violet more?</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">To throw a perfume on the violet</span><br />

<p>Shakespeare informs us in "King John."<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> With

<p>In truth, the tiny flower seems to nod among its

upon a bank of violets<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> (<a href="#Page_44">see page 44</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ophelia</i> laments that she has no violets to give
to the court ladies and lords, for "they withered"
when her father died, she tells us. Shakespeare
also associates violets with melancholy occasions.
<i>Marina</i> enters in "Pericles" with a basket of flowers
on her arm, saying:<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="caption center half">SHAKESPEARE'S BIRTHPLACE, STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</p>
</div>

<p>Bacon deemed it most necessary "to know what
flowers and plants do best perfume the air," and
he thought "that which above all others yields the
sweetest smell is the violet, and next to that the
musk-rose." <a href="#Page_44">(See page 44.)</a></p>

<p>"Perhaps of all Warwickshire flowers," writes a
native of Shakespeare's country, "none are so plentiful
as violets; our own little churchyard of Whitechurch
is sheeted with them. They grow in every
hedgebank until the whole air is filled with their
fragrance. The wastes near Stratford are sometimes
purple as far as the eyes can see with the flowers of
<i>viola canina</i>. Our English violets are twelve in
number. The plant is still used in medicine and
acquired of late a notoriety as a suggested cancer
cure; and in Shakespeare's time was eaten raw with
onions and lettuces and also mingled in broth and
used to garnish dishes, while crystallized violets are
not unknown in the present day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>For the beauty of its form, for the depth and
richness of its color, for the graceful drooping of
its stalk and the nodding of its head, for its lovely
heart-shaped leaf and above all for its delicious perfume,
the violet is admired. Then when we gaze
into its tiny face and note the delicacy of its veins,
which Shakespeare so often mentions, we gain a
sense of its deeper beauty and significance.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes Watson observed:</p>

<p>"I give one instance of Nature's care for the look
of the stamens and pistils of a flower. In the blossom
of the Scented Violet the stamens form, by their
convergence, a little orange beak. At the end of
this beak is the summit of the pistil, a tiny speck
of green, but barely visible to the naked eye. Yet
small as it is, it completes the color of the flower,
by softening the orange, and we can distinctly see
that if this mere point were removed, there would
be imperfection for the want of it."</p>

<p>St. Francis de Sales, a contemporary of Shakespeare,
gave a lovely description of the flower when
he said:</p>

<p>"A true widow is in the Church as a March Violet,
shedding around an exquisite perfume by the fragrance
of her devotion and always hidden under the
ample leaves of her lowliness and by her subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
coloring, showing the spirit of her mortification.
She seeks untrodden and solitary places."</p>

<p>The violet's qualities of lowliness, humility, and
sweetness have always appealed to poets. The violet
is also beloved because it is one of the earliest
spring flowers. Violets are, like primroses and cowslips,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">The first to rise</span><br />
<span class="i0">And smile beneath Spring's wakening skies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The courier of a band of coming flowers.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The violet was also an emblem of constancy. At
the floral games, instituted by Clemence Isaure at
Toulouse in the Fourteenth Century, the prize was
a golden violet, because the poetess had once sent
a violet to her Knight as a token of faithfulness.
With the Troubadours the violet was a symbol of
constancy. In "A Handful of Pleasant Delights," a
popular song-book published in Elizabeth's reign in
1566, there is a poem called "A Nosegay always
Sweet for Lovers to send Tokens of Love at New
Year's tide, or for Fairings, as they in their minds
shall be disposed to write." This poem contains a
verse to the violet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Violet is for faithfulness</span><br />
<span class="i21">Which in me shall abide;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hoping likewise that from your heart</span>
<span class="i21"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>You will not let it slide,</span><br />

<span class="i21">As you have now begun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then forever to abide</span><br />
<span class="i21">Then you my heart have won.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The violet has always held a loved place in the
English garden. Gerard writes quaintly in his
"Herbal":</p>

<p>"The Black, or Purple Violets, or March Violets,
of the garden have a great prerogative above all
others, not only because the mind conceiveth a certain
pleasure and recreation by smelling and
handling of those most odoriferous flowers, but also
for the very many by these Violets receive ornament
and comely grace; for there be made of them garlands
for the head, nosegays and poesies, which are
delightful to look on and pleasant to smell to, speaking
nothing of their appropriate virtues; yea, gardens
themselves receive by these the greatest ornament
of all chiefest beauty and most gallant grace;
and the recreation of the mind, which is taken thereby,
cannot but be very good and honest; for they
admonish and stir up a man to that which is comely
and honest; for flowers through their beauty,
variety of color and exquisite form do bring to a
liberal and great mind the remembrance of honesty,
comeliness and all kinds of virtue."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Proserpine was gathering violets among other
flowers in the fields of Enna in Sicily when Pluto
carried her off. Shakespeare touched upon the story
most exquisitely, through the lips of <i>Perdita</i>, as
quoted above.</p>

<p>Another Greek myth accounts for the Greek word
for the violet, which is <i>ion</i>. It seems when, in order
to protect her from the persecutions of Juno, Jove
transformed lovely Europa into a white heifer whom
he named Io, he caused sweet violets to spring up
from the earth wherever the white cow placed her
lips; and from her name, Io, the flower acquired the
name <i>ion</i>.</p>

<p>The Athenians adored the flower. Tablets were
engraved with the word <i>ion</i> and set up everywhere
in Athens; and of all sobriquets the citizens preferred
that of "Athenian crowned with violets."</p>

<p>The Persians also loved the violet and made a
delicious wine from it. A sherbet flavored with
violet blossoms is served in Persia and Arabia to-day
at feasts; and Mohammedans say: "The excellence
of the violet is as the excellence of El Islam
above all other religions."</p>

<p>has immortalized this little flower of the English
meadows, but little known in our country. The
lady-smock is very common in England in early
spring. Properly speaking it should be Our Lady's-smock,
as it is one of the many plants dedicated to
the Virgin Mary and bearing her name. The list is
a long one, including Lady's-slippers, Lady's-bower,
Lady's-cushion, Lady's-mantle, Lady's-laces, Lady's-looking-glass,
Lady's-garters, Lady's-thimble,
Lady's-hair (maidenhair fern), Lady's-seal, Lady's-thistle,
Lady's-bedstraw, Lady's-fingers, Lady's-gloves,
and so on. These flowers, originally
dedicated to Venus, Juno, and Diana in Greek
and Roman mythology and to Freya and Bertha
in Northern lore and legend, were gradually trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ferred
to the Virgin with the spread of Christianity.
The Lady's-smock takes its name from the
fancied, but far-fetched, resemblance to a smock.
It is said, by way of explanation, that when these
flowers are seen in great quantity they suggest the
comparison of linen smocks bleaching on the green
meadow. Other names for the plant are Cuckoo-flower,
Meadow-cress, Spinks, and Mayflower; and
in Norfolk the <i>Cardamine pratensis</i> is called Canterbury-bells.
The petals have a peculiarly soft
and translucent quality with a faint lilac tinge.
Shakespeare describes the flower as "silver white,"
an epithet that has puzzled many persons. However,
one ardent Shakespeare lover has made a discovery:</p>

<p>"Gather a lady-smock as you tread the rising
grass in fragrant May, and although in individuals
the petals are sometimes cream color, as a rule the
flower viewed in the hand is lilac&mdash;pale, but purely
and indisputably lilac. Where then is the silver-whiteness?
It is the meadows, remember, that are
painted, when, as often happens, the flower is so
plentiful as to hide the turf, and most particularly
if the ground be a slope and the sun be shining from
behind us, all is changed; the flowers are lilac no
longer; the meadow is literally 'silver-white.' So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
it is always&mdash;Shakespeare's epithets are like prisms.
Let them tremble in the sunshine and we discover
that it is he who knows best."</p>

<p><span class="lb">CUCKOO BUDS</span> (<i>Ranunculus</i>). It is quite possible
that in "cuckoo buds of yellow hue" Shakespeare
meant the blossoms of the buttercup or kingcup
(called by the country people of Warwickshire
horse-blobs). Some authorities claim that cuckoo-buds
is intended to represent the lesser celandine, of
which Wordsworth was so fond that he wrote three
poems to it. Others call cuckoo-buds <i>carmine
pratensis</i>; but that could hardly be possible because
Shakespeare speaks of "lady-smocks all silver white"
in one line and "cuckoo buds of yellow hue" in the
succeeding line.</p>

<p>There is much confusion in the identification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
lady-smocks, cuckoo-buds, cuckoo-flowers, and crow-flowers,
for they are more or less related.</p>

<p>Gerard says: "Our Lady-Smock is also called the
cuckoo-flower because it flowers in April and May
when the cuckoo doth begin to sing her pleasant
notes without stammering."</p>

<p>Adonis, the beautiful youth, beloved of Venus,
was wounded by a boar, to which he had given chase.
Venus found him as he lay dying on the grass. To
make him immortal she changed him into an anemone,
or windflower. Naturally the flower was
dedicated to Venus.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Pliny asserted the anemone only blooms when
the wind blows.</p>

<p>The flower was associated with illness in the days
of the Egyptians and also during the Middle Ages,
when there was also a superstition that the first anemone
gathered would prove a charm against disease.
The first spring blossom was, therefore, eagerly
searched for, delightedly plucked, and carefully
guarded. No token of affection was more prized by
a loved one going off on a journey than the gift of
an anemone. An old ballad has the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Anemones were greatly valued in Elizabethan
gardens. Indeed it was a fad to grow them.
Parkinson distinguishes the family of anemones as
"the wild and the tame, or manured, both of them
nourished up in gardens." He classifies them still
further as "those that have broader leaves and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
that have thinner, or more jagged, leaves"; and then
again into those "that bear single flowers and those
that bear double flowers." The wild kinds included
"all the Pulsatillas, or Pasque (Easter) flowers."
Parkinson mentions many varieties. He describes
the "tame" anemones as white, yellow, purple, crimson,
scarlet, blush gredeline (between peach color
and violet), orange-tawny, apple-blossom, rose-color,
and many others. From his list we can have
no doubt that Shakespeare's flower was one of the
purple star anemones&mdash;the <i>Anemone purpurea
striata stellata</i>, "whose flowers have many white
lines and stripes through the leaves." Parkinson's
name is "the purple-striped Anemone."</p>

<p>Of recent years anemones have again become the
fashion.</p>

<p>"How gorgeous are these flowers to behold," exclaims
Ryder Haggard, "with their hues of vivid
scarlet and purple! To be really appreciated, however,
they should, I think, be seen in their native
home, the East. In the neighborhood of Mount
Tabor in Palestine, I have met with them in such
millions that for miles the whole plain is stained red,
blue and white, growing so thickly indeed that to
walk across it without setting foot on a flower at
every step would be difficult. I believe, and I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
that this view is very generally accepted, that these
are the same lilies of the field that 'toil not neither
do they spin,' which Our Lord used to illustrate His
immortal lesson. Truly Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these."</p>

<p>The Adonis flower (<i>Flos Adonis</i>) spoken of by
Ben Jonson and others has nothing to do with the
anemone. It is a kind of camomile. "Some have
taken the red kind to be a kind of Anemone," says
Parkinson. "The most usual name now with us is
<i>Flos Adonis</i>. In English it is also called the Mayweed
and Rosarubie and Adonis Flower."</p>

<p><span class="lb">HAREBELL</span> (<i>Scilla nutans</i>).<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The "azured
harebell," which Shakespeare uses in "Cymbeline"
for comparison with the delicate veins of <i>Fidele</i>
(<i>Imogen</i>), has been identified as the English jacinth,
blue harebell, or hare's-bell. Browne's "Pastorals"
show that this flower was only worn by faithful
lovers; and, therefore, the flower is most appropriately
selected for association with <i>Imogen</i>.
Browne says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Harebell, for her stainless, azured hue</span><br />
<span class="i0">Claims to be worn of none but who are true.</span>

<p>This flower is also called the "wild hyacinth." Blossoming
in May and June, it is one of the precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>ornaments of English woods. "Dust of sapphire," its
jewel-like flowers have been called.</p>

<p>"Our English jacinth, or harebells," writes
Parkinson, "is so common everywhere that it scarce
needeth any description. It beareth divers long narrow
green leaves, not standing upright, not yet fully
lying on the ground, among which springeth up the
stalk, bearing at the top many long and hollow
flowers, hanging down their heads, all forwards, for
the most part, parted at the brims into six parts,
turning up their points a little again, of a sweetish,
but heady, scent, like unto the Grapeflower. The
heads for seed are long and square, wherein is much
black seed. The color of the flowers is in some of
a deep blue tending to purple, in others of a paler
blue, or of a bleak blue tending to an ash color.
Some are pure white and some are parti-colored blue
and white; and some are of a fine delayed purplish
red, or bluish color, which some call a pearl color."</p>

court), exclaims, "I am that flower," to which
<i>Dumain</i> and <i>Longueville</i> reply in derision, "That
mint! That columbine!" Of the columbine of
Shakespeare's time, Parkinson says:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>"There be many sorts of Columbines as well
differing in form as color of the flowers, and of them,
both single and double, carefully nursed up in our
gardens for the delight both of their forms and
colors. The variety of the colors of these flowers
are very much, for some are wholly white, some of a
blue, or violet, color, others of a bluish, or flesh,
color, or deep, or pale, red, or of a dead purple, or
dead murrey color, as Nature listeth to show."</p>

<p>The generic name is derived from the word <i>aquila</i>,
an eagle, because of the fancied resemblance of some
parts of the flower to the talons of an eagle. The
English name comes from the Latin <i>columba</i>, a dove,
from the likeness of its nectaries to the heads of
doves in a ring around a dish, or to the figure of a
dove hovering with expanded wings discovered by
pulling off one petal with its detached sepals. Hence
this was called the dove plant. From the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
it was the favorite plant of the lion it was called
<i>Herba leonis</i>.</p>

<p>The columbine was valued for many medicinal
virtues.</p>

<p>"The scarlet and yellow columbine," writes
Matthew, "is one of our most beautiful wild flowers.
It is my experience that certain flowers have certain
favorite haunts, which are exclusively held by them
year after year. This flower is in its prime about
the first of June, and is nearly always found beside
some lichen-covered rock."</p>

<p>The English and American flowers differ, although
the early colonists brought the English
flower with them. Grant Allen tells us:</p>

<p>"The English columbine is a more developed type
than the American scarlet, is never yellow in the
wild state, but often purple, and, sometimes, blue.
Larkspur, ranking still higher in the floral scale, in
virtue of its singular bilateral blossoms, is usually
blue, though it sometimes reverts to reddish-purple,
or white; while monkshood, the very top of the tree
on this line of development, is usually deep ultramarine,
only a few species being prettily variegated
with pale blue and white. As a rule, blue flowers
are the very highest; and the reason seems to lie in
the strange fact, first discovered by Sir John Lub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>bock,
that bees are fonder of blue than of any other
color. Still, they are fond enough even of red; and
one may be sure that the change from yellow to
scarlet in the petals of the American columbine is
due in one way or another to the selective tastes and
preferences of the higher insects."</p>

<p>The colors of the American columbine are dark
opaque blues, smoky purples, dull pinks, pale blues,
lavenders, reds and yellows&mdash;an infinite variety!</p>

<p>"The flowering of the 'Columbine Commendable,'
as Skelton called it four hundred years ago," says
Harriet L. Keeler, "marks the beginning of summer.
The reign of the bulbs is over;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the petals of the early roses are falling; the elder-blossoms
show white along the fence rows; and the
season waxes to its prime.</p>

<p>"A wild flower of English fields, the columbine
was early transferred into English gardens and has
held its place securely there for at least five hundred
years. Its seeds were among the treasures borne
over the sea to the New World and it early bloomed
in Pilgrim gardens. This primitive stock still persists
in cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"The flower of the columbine is a unique and interesting
form. The sepals look like petals and
the petals are veritable horns of plenty filled with
nectar at the closed ends for the swarms of bees
which gather about. The sweets are produced by
the blossoms on a generous scale, and to a columbine
bed in full bloom the bees come, big and little, noisy
and silent&mdash;all giddy with the feast. There is no
use trying to drive them away for they will not go.
Clumsy bumble bees with tongues long enough to
reach the honey by the open door, wise honey bees
who have learned to take the short road to the
nectar by biting through the spur, quiet brown bees,
little green carpenters&mdash;all are there, 'vehement,
voluble, velvety,' in a glorious riot of happiness and
honey.</p>

<p>"The doubling occurs chiefly with the petals; the
sepals, as a rule, hold true to the five, but the petals
sometimes double in number, becoming ten spurs in
place of five, and each spur becomes a nest of spurs
like a set of Chinese cups, though the innermost are
frequently imperfect."</p>

<p>The columbine frequently appears in the paintings
of the Great Masters. Luini has immortalized
it in his picture of this title now in the gallery of
the Hermitage at Petrograd. A fascinating woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with a smile as enchanting&mdash;if not so famous&mdash;as
Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" holds an exquisitely
painted columbine in her left hand and
gazes at it with tender, loving emotion.</p>

<p>The early Italian and Flemish painters include
the columbine with the rose, lily, pink, violet, strawberry,
and clover in the gardens where the Madonna
sits with the Holy Child. The reason that the
columbine was chosen as a flower of religious symbolism
was because of the little doves formed by
the five petals. The columbine signified the "Seven
Gifts of the Holy Spirit," and the Flemish painters
in their zeal for accuracy corrected the number of
petals to seven to make the flower agree with the
teaching of the Church.</p>

<p>Yet although the columbine has these religious
associations, we always think of it as an airy,
piquant flower, the gay and irresponsible dancer of
the rocks and dells, clad, as it were, in fantastic and
parti-colored dress. Graceful in form and charming
in color, put together with extreme delicacy
on slender, flexible, fragile stems and adorned with
a leaf approaching that of the fern in delicacy and
lace-like beauty, the columbine is one of the most
delightful of flowers. Always associated with folly,
we love it none the less for that, for there are times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
when we enjoy <i>Harlequin</i> and <i>Columbine</i> among
our flowers,&mdash;and these fantastic and frivolous
columbines dancing so gaily in the breeze always fill
us with delight.</p>

<p>When in blossom the broom is lovely to look upon.
The large yellow flowers are gracefully arranged on
the branches, and its perfume is delightful.</p>

<p>"Sweet is the Broome-flower!" exclaims Spenser.
The broom is the <i>Planta genesta</i>, from which the
Plantagenets took their name. The flower, having
become heraldic during that dynasty, was embroidered
on the clothes of the Plantagenet family and
imitated in their jewels. When they died it was
carved on their monuments. The story goes that
Geoffrey, Earl of Anjou, father of Henry II of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
England, once on his way to a field of battle, had to
climb a rocky path, and he noticed as he went along
the bushes of yellow broom clinging to the rocks.
Breaking off a branch he, placed it in his helmet
with the words: "This golden plant shall be my
emblem henceforth. Rooted firmly among rocks and
upholding that which is ready to fall." His son,
Henry, was called "the royal sprig of Genesta."
The golden plume of broom-flowers was worn by
the Plantagenets until the last one of the line, Richard
III, lost the Crown of England to Henry VII,
the first of the Tudors.</p>

<p>In 1264 the <i>Planta genesta</i> was honored by St.
Louis, who instituted the Order of Genest on his
marriage with Marguerite. The Knights of the
Genest wore chains made of the broom-flower alternating
with the fleur-de-lis. Shakespeare speaks of
a "broom-staff" and sends <i>Puck</i></p>

make besoms for sweeping and also for staffs to walk
with and to lean upon.</p>

Rose-bush, but more usually abideth low and
shooteth forth many branches from the Rose-bush
(and is but seldom suffered to grow up as the
Damask Rose into standards) with a green bark
thinner set with prickles and longer and greener
leaves on the upper side than in the white, yet with
an eye of white upon them, five likewise most
usually set upon a stalk and grayish, or whitish, underneath.
The Roses, or flowers, do very much vary
according to their site and abiding, for some are of
an orient red, or deep crimson, color and very double
(although never so double as the White), which,
when it is full blown, hath the largest leaves of any
other Rose; some of them again are paler, tending
somewhat to a Damask; and some are of so pale a
red as that it is rather of the color of a Canker Rose,
yet all for the most part with larger leaves than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the Damask, and with many more yellow threads in
the middle. The scent hereof is much better than
in the White, but not comparable to the excellency
of the Damask Rose, yet this Rose, being well dried
and well kept, will hold both color and scent longer
than the Damask."</p>

<p><span class="lb">THE WHITE ROSE</span> (<i>Rosa Anglica alba</i>).</p>

<p>"The White Rose is of two kinds," says Parkinson,
"the one more thick and double than the other.
The one riseth up in some shadowy places unto eight
or ten foot high, with a stock of great bigness for a
rose. The other growing seldom higher than a
Damask Rose. Both these Roses have somewhat
smaller and whiter green leaves than in many other
Roses, five most usually set on a stock and more
white underneath, as also a whiter green bark, armed
with sharp thorns, or prickles. The flowers in the
one are whitish with an eye, or shew, of a blush,
especially towards the ground, or bottom, of the
flower, very thick, double and close set together;
and, for the most part, not opening itself so largely
and fully as either the Red, or Damask Rose. The
other more white, less thick and double and opening
itself more, and some so little double (as but of two
or three rows) that they might be held to be single,
yet all of little or no smell at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>From this <i>Rosa alba</i>, Pliny says, the isle of Albion
derived its name&mdash;a happy thought when we remember
that the rose is still the national emblem of
England.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MUSK-ROSE</span> (<i>Rosa moschata</i>). Musk-roses and
eglantine mingled with honeysuckle formed the
canopy beneath which <i>Titania</i> slumbered on a bank
made soft and lovely with wild thyme, oxlips and
nodding violets. And in the "coronet of fresh and
fragrant flowers" that the dainty little fairy queen
placed upon the hairy temples of <i>Bottom</i> the
Weaver, musk-roses were conspicuous; and the
sweetness of these was intensified by "the round and
Orient pearls of dew" that swelled upon the petals,
as the "pretty flowerets bewailed their own disgrace."</p>

<p>It is this delicious rose which Keats, when listening
to the nightingale, sensed rather than visualized
in the twilight dimness:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The coming musk-rose full of dewy wine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The musk-rose was adored by the Elizabethans.
Lord Bacon considered its scent to come next to
that of the violet, and before all other flowers.</p>

<p>"You remember the great bush at the corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the south wall just by the Blue Drawing-room window?"
writes Mrs. Gaskell in "My Lady Ludlow."
"That is the old musk-rose, Shakespeare's musk-rose,
which is dying out through the kingdom now. The
scent is unlike the scent of any other rose, or of any
other flower."</p>

<p>The musk-rose is a native of North Africa, Spain,
and India (Nepal). Hakluyt in 1582 gave the date
of its introduction into England. "The turkey-cocks
and hens," he says, "were brought in about fifty
years past; the Artichoke in the time of Henry the
Eighth; and of later times was procured out of Italy
the Musk Rose plant and the Plum called Perdigwena."</p>

<p>Turning now to Parkinson and opening his big
volume at the page "<i>Rosa Moschata</i>, simple and
multiplex," we read:</p>

<p>"The Musk Rose, both single and double, rises
up oftentimes to a very great height that it overgroweth
any arbor in a Garden, or being set by a
house side to be ten or twelve foot high, or more,
but especially the single kind with many green far
spread branches armed with a few sharp great
thorns, as the wilder sorts of Roses are, whereof
these are accounted to be kinds, having small dark
green leaves on them, not much bigger than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
leaves of Eglantines. The Flowers come forth at
the tops of the branches, many together as it were
in an umbel, or tuft, which, for the most part, do
flower all at a time, or not long one after another,
every one standing on a pretty long stalk and are of
a pale whitish, or cream color, both the single and
the double, the single being small flowers consisting
of five leaves with many yellow threads in the middle;
and the double bearing more double flowers,
as if they were once or twice more double than the
single, with yellow thrums also in the middle, both
of them of a very sweet and pleasing smell, resembling
musk. Some there be that have avouched
that the chief scent of these Roses consisteth not in
the leaves but in the threads of the Flowers."</p>

<p>The color of the musk-rose is white, slightly
tinged with pink.</p>

<p><span class="lb">EGLANTINE</span>; <span class="smcap half">ALSO</span> <span class="lb">SWEETBRIER</span> (<i>Rosa
eglanteria</i>). This is a conspicuous adornment of
<i>Titania's</i> bower, and is as remarkable for its beauty
as for its scent. The pink flowers with their golden
threads in the center are familiar to every one.</p>

<p>"The Sweet Briar, or Eglantine," Parkinson
writes, "is not only planted in Gardens for the sweetness
of its leaves, but growing wild in many woods
and hedges, hath exceeding long green shoots armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
with the cruellest sharp and strong thorns and
thicker set than is in any Rose, either Wild or tame.
The leaves are smaller than in most of those that
are nourished up in Gardens, seven or nine, most
usually set together on a rib, or stalk, very green and
sweeter in smell about the leaves of any other kind
of Rose. The flowers are small, single, blush
Roses."</p>

<p><span class="lb">PROVENÇAL</span>, <span class="smcap half">OR</span> <span class="lb">PROVINS</span> (<i>Centifolia</i>). This
old-fashioned cabbage-rose of globular flowers, massive
foliage, hard knob of leaves in the center, and
sweet perfume is affectionately known as the "Hundred
Leaf," or <i>rose à cent feuilles</i>. Parkinson gives
two varieties: the incarnate, or flesh-color; and the
red.</p>

<p>In our country the light pink, or incarnate, is the
more familiar. What associations does it not conjure
up? To many of us Dean Hole's words make
a touching appeal:</p>

<p>"The blushing, fresh, fragrant Provence! It was
to many of us <i>the</i> Rose of our childhood and its
delicious perfume passes through the outer sense into
our hearts gladdening them with bright and happy
dreams, saddening them with love and child awakenings.
It brings more to us than the fairness and
sweet smell of a Rose. We passed in our play to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
gaze on it with the touch of a vanished hand in ours,
with a father's blessing on our heads and a mother's
prayer that we might never lose our love of the beautiful.
Happy they who return, or regain, that love."</p>

<p><span class="lb">THE DAMASK ROSE</span> (<i>Rosa damascena</i>) is a
native of Syria, whence it was brought to Europe
about 1270 by Thibault IV, Comte de Brie, returning
from the Holy Land. We know exactly when
it was introduced into England because Hakluyt,
writing in 1582, says: "In time of memory many
things have been brought in that were not here before,
as the Damask Rose by Doctor Liniker, King
Henry the Seventh and King Henry the Eighth's
physician."</p>

<p>"Gloves as sweet as Damask Roses" <i>Autolycus</i>
carries in his peddler's pack for "lads to give their
dears," along with masks for their faces, perfume,
necklace-amber, pins, quoifs, and "lawn as white as
driven snow."<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Parkinson informs us:</p>

<p>"The Damask Rose-bush is more usually nourished
up to a competent height to stand alone (which
we call Standards), than any other Rose. The bark,
both of the stock and branches, is not fully so green
as the Red or White Rose. The leaves are green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
with an eye of white upon them. The flowers are
of a fine deep blush color, as all know, with some
pale yellow threads in the middle, and are not so
thick and double as the White, not being blown with
so large and great leaves as the Red, but of the
most excellent sweet pleasant scent, far surpassing
all other Roses or Flowers, being neither heady, nor
too strong, nor stuffing or unpleasant sweet, as many
other flowers.</p>

<p>"The Rose is of exceeding great use with us, for
the Damask Rose (besides the superexcellent sweet
water it yieldeth, being distilled, or the perfume of
its leaves, being dried, serving to fill sweet bags)
serveth to cause solubleness of the body, made into
a syrup, or preserved with sugar, moist or candied."
The name is obviously from Damascus.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CANKER</span> (<i>Rosa canina</i>). This is the wild dog-rose
common to many countries. The name dog-rose
was given to it by the Romans, because the root
was said to cure the bite of a mad dog. Pliny says
the remedy was discovered in a dream by the mother
of a soldier who had been bitten by a mad dog. <i>Don

<p><span class="lb">VARIEGATED ROSE</span> (<i>Rosa versicolor</i>) of
Shakespeare's plays is the curious bush which produces
at the same time red roses, white roses, and
roses of red mottled with white and of white mottled
with red. The growth of the tree is stiff and erect
and the flowers have a sweet scent. The rose is often
called the "York and Lancaster." Parkinson says:</p>

<p>"This Rose in the form and order of the growing
is nearest unto the ordinary Damask Rose both for
stem, branch, leaf and flower, the difference consisting
in this&mdash;that the flower (being of the same
largeness and doubleness as the Damask Rose) hath
the one half of it sometimes of a pale whitish color
and the other half of a paler damask color than the
ordinary. This happeneth so many times, and sometimes
also the flower hath divers stripes and marks
on it, one leaf white, or striped with white, and the
other half blush, or striped with blush, sometimes
all striped, or spotted over, and at other times little
or no stripes, or marks, at all, as Nature listeth to
play with varieties in this as in other flowers. Yet
this I have observed, that the longer it abideth blown
open to the sun, the paler and the fewer stripes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
marks, or spots will be seen in it. The smell is of a
weak Damask Rose scent."</p>

<p>This rose recalls the old song of a "Lover to His
Lancastrian Mistress," on handing her a white rose:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If this fair rose offend thy sight,</span><br />
<span class="i21">Placed in thy bosom bare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">'T will blush to find itself less white,</span><br />
<span class="i21">And turn Lancastrian there,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if thy ruby lip it spy,</span><br />
<span class="i21">As kiss it thou mayst deign,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With envy pale 'twill lose its dye,</span><br />
<span class="i21">And Yorkish turn again.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his play of "King Henry VI," which passes during
the Wars of the Roses, Shakespeare introduces
the noted scene in the Temple Garden, London,
where the emblem of the Yorkists (a white rose)
and that of the Lancastrians (a red rose) is chosen.
Richard Plantagenet plucks a white rose and the
Earl of Somerset a red rose from rose-bushes that
are still growing and blooming in the same spot, as
they did when Shakespeare imagined the scene in
"King Henry VI."<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_52" id="Footnote_51_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Part I, Act II, Scene IV.</p></div>

<p>In Shakespeare's day the rose was enormously
cultivated. In the gardens of Ely Place, the home
of Queen Elizabeth's dashing lord chancellor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
twenty bushels of roses were gathered annually&mdash;a
good deal for the time.</p>

<p>"About thirty species of roses," writes Edmund
Gosse, "were known to the Elizabethan gardeners,
and most of them did particularly well in London
until in the reign of James I, when the increasing
smoke of coal-fires exterminated the most lovely and
the most delicate species, the double yellow rose.
Things grew rapidly worse in this respect, until
Parkinson in despair, cried out: 'Neither herb, nor
tree, will prosper since the use of sea-coal.' Up to
that time in London, and afterwards in country-places,
the rose preserved its vogue. It was not
usually grown for pleasure, since the petals had a
great commercial value; there was a brisk trade in
dried roses and a precious sweet water was distilled
from the damask rose. The red varieties of the rose
were considered the best medicinally, and they produced
that rose syrup which was so widely used both
as a cordial and as an aperient. The fashion for
keeping <i>potpourri</i> in dwelling-rooms became so
prevalent that the native gardens could not supply
enough, and dried yellow roses became a recognized
import from Constantinople. We must think of the
parlors of the ladies who saw Shakespeare's plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
performed for the first time as all redolent with the
perfume of dried, spiced and powdered rose-leaves."
In "Sonnet LIV" Shakespeare says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rose looks fair, but fairer it we deem</span><br />
<span class="i0">For that sweet odor which doth in it live.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the perfumèd tincture of the roses,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly</span><br />
<span class="i0">When summer's breath their maskèd buds discloses.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, for their virtue only is their show,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For twenty-seven centuries&mdash;and more&mdash;the rose
has been considered queen of flowers. Her perfume,
her color, her elegance, and her mystic fascination
have won all hearts. Shakespeare says: "A rose by
any other name would smell as sweet." In one sense
that is true; but we would not be willing to try another
title, for the very word rose is a beautiful one
and conjures up a particular and very special vision
of sweetness and beauty.</p>

<p>Thousands and thousands of poems have been
written in praise of this flower, ever since Sappho
sang to her lyre the words "Ho! the rose! Ho! the
rose!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton wrote:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You Violets that first appear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By your pure purple mantles known,</span><br />

<span class="i0">As if the Spring were all your own,</span><br />
<span class="i0">What are you when the Rose is blown?</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Hood sang:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Cowslip is a country wench;</span><br />
<span class="i21">The Violet is a nun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I will woo the dainty Rose</span><br />
<span class="i21">The queen of every one.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Shelley:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the rose, like a nymph to the bath addrest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which unveiled the depths of her glowing breast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till, fold after fold, to the fainting air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The soul of her beauty and love laid bare.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shelley's "fold after fold" reminds us that Ruskin
points out that one of the rose's beauties is that her
petals make shadows over and over again of their
own loveliness.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes Watson has, perhaps, been the most
successful of all writers in putting into words the
reasons why the rose has such power over mankind:</p>

<p>"The flower has something almost human about
it&mdash;warm, breathing, soft as the fairest cheek; of
white, no longer snowy like the narcissus, but flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
with hues of animating pink; either flower, white
or red, being alike symbolical of glowing, youthful
passion."</p>

<p>In the East the rose gardens have been famed for
centuries. The flower is said to burst into bloom at
the voice of the nightingale. The poet Jami says:
"You may place a handful of fragrant herbs of
flowers before the nightingale, yet he wishes not in
his constant heart for more than the sweet breath of
his beloved rose." It is said that an Arabian doctor
discovered the recipe for rose-water in the Tenth
Century; but the perfume may be older than that.
The <i>Rosa centifolia</i> is the blossom used. The Indians
and Persians have known how to make their
attar of rose for centuries.</p>

<p>A large volume would be required to chronicle the
romance of the rose, for it is the flower of love,
beauty, and poetry. It is dedicated to Venus, and
Venus is frequently represented as wearing a crown
of roses. Her son, Eros or Cupid, is also wreathed
and garlanded with roses. Cupid gave a rose to
Harpocrates, god of silence&mdash;hence the rose is also
the symbol of silence. "Under the rose," a saying
that expresses silence and secrecy, is derived from
this legend. A siren holding a rose stands among
the sculptured ruins of Pæstum. Roses and myrtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
adorned the brides of Greece and Rome. The profusion
of roses used for decorations at feasts astounds
us even to-day. No epicure was satisfied with the
cup of Falernian wine unless it were perfumed with
roses; and the Spartan soldiers at the Battle of
Cirrha actually refused wine because it was not perfumed
with roses. This makes us wonder if those
Spartan mothers, of whom we hear so much, were
really as severe as they are reputed to have been. Red
roses were dedicated to Jupiter; damask roses to
Venus; and white roses to Diana or the moon. The
rose was given to the Virgin Mary as her particular
flower; and many Italian painters as well as Flemish,
Spanish, and German, have painted the Madonna
of the Rose, the Madonna of the Rose-hedge,
the Madonna of the Rose-bush, and the Madonna
of the Rose-garden. The rosary, introduced by St.
Dominick in commemoration of his having been
shown a Chaplet of roses by the Virgin, originally
consisted of rose-leaves pressed into balls.</p>

<p><span class="lb">THE LILY</span> (<i>Lilium candidum</i>). The fact that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>Shakespeare loved one of the most beautiful families
of flowers that grace the earth, and knew the many
varieties that grew in the English gardens of his
day, which include the Lily-of-the-Valley (in his
time called Lily Conally); the splendid yellow lilies;
the red martagon and spotted martagon (tiger-lilies);
as well as the pure white lily. Parkinson,
who writes so beautifully of plants and blossoms,
did not neglect the lily. He says: "The lily is
the most stately flower among many," and he directs
attention "to the wonderful variety of lilies known
to us in these days, much more so than in former

<p>First on the list comes the white lily, which has
always been regarded from time immemorial as the
most beautiful member of this most beautiful
family, a picture of purity with its white silken
petals exquisitely set off by the yellow anthers and
breathing such delicious fragrance. This is the lily
of which Shelley sings:</p>

<span class="i0">Gazed through clear dew on the tender sky.</span>

</div>

<p>"The ordinary White Lily, <i>Lilium candidum</i>,"
writes Parkinson, "scarce needeth any description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
it is so well known and so frequent in every garden.
The stalk is of a blackish green color, having many
fair broad and long green leaves. The flower stands
upon long green footstalks, of a fair white color,
with a long pointell in the middle and white chives
tipt with yellow pendants about it. The smell is
something heady and strong. It is called <i>Lilium
album</i>, the White Lily, by most writers; but by
poets, <i>Rosa Junonis</i>, Juno's Rose."</p>

<p>How perfect is this flower! Texture, form, hue,
sheen, perfume&mdash;all express exquisite loveliness.
The lily refreshes us with its cool beauty and its
purity and lifts our thoughts upward to heaven.</p>

<p>Gerard describes eight lilies in his "Herbal"
(1597), all of which were known to Shakespeare.
Certainly among <i>Perdita's</i> flowers was the martagon,
which takes its name from the Italian <i>martagone</i>,
meaning a Turk's turban. This lily is also called
"Chalcedonian" and "Scarlet martagon" and
"Turk's Cap," by Parkinson, who tells us that the
"<i>Lilium rubrum Byzantinum Martagon Constantinopolitanum</i>,
or the red martagon of Constantinople,
is become so common everywhere and so well
known to all lovers of these delights that I shall
seem unto them to lose time to bestow many lines
upon it; yet because it is so fair a flower and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
at the first so highly esteemed, it deserveth its place
and commendations. It riseth out of the ground
bearing a round, brownish stalk, beset with many
fair green leaves confusedly thereon, but not so
broad as the common White Lily, upon the top
whereof stand one, two, or three, or more, flowers
upon long footstalks, which hang down their heads
and turn up their leaves again, of an excellent red
crimson color and sometimes paler, having a long
pointell in the middle compassed with whitish chives,
tipt with loose yellow pendants, of a reasonable good
scent, but somewhat faint. We have another of this
kind, the Red Spotted Martagon of Constantinople,
that groweth somewhat greater and higher with a
larger flower, and of a deeper color, spotted with
divers black spots, or streaks, and lines, as is to be
seen in Mountain Lilies."</p>

<p>The martagon belongs to the tiger-lily class,
whose characteristics have been so imaginatively

<p>Shakespeare has many beautiful passages concerning
the lily. He often refers to its whiteness. He
considers it as impossible a task "to paint the lily"
as it is "to gild refined gold," or "to throw a perfume
on the violet."</p>

<p>How the lily was loved by the ancients! The
Egyptians adored it; the Persians named cities for
it; the Hebrews worshiped it. The Greeks and
Romans called the lily Juno's flower, and fancied
that the flower owed its very existence to drops of
milk spilled on earth from Juno's white breast when
she was nursing the infant Hercules.</p>

<p>The church consecrated the lily to the Virgin
Mary. It was her flower as Queen of Heaven. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
many old religious paintings of the Annunciation,
the Angel Gabriel, appearing before the Virgin,
usually holds the "Annunciation Lily," or "Madonna
Lily" in his hand. Joseph's staff was said to
have blossomed into lilies, and it is the white lily
that is usually represented in this connection.</p>

<p>Wonderful family this lily tribe, flowers of the
grand style and haughty demeanor! Ruskin enlightens
us as to why it is every one loves them and
why they are entwined with many of our thoughts
of art and life:</p>

<p>"Under the name of <i>Drosidæ</i> come plants delighting
in interrupted moisture&mdash;moisture which comes
either partially, or at certain seasons&mdash;into dry
ground. They are not water-plants, but the signs
of water resting among dry places. In the <i>Drosidæ</i>
the floral spirit passes into the calix also, and the
entire flower becomes a six-rayed star, bursting out
of the stem laterally, as if it were the first of flowers
and had made its way to the light by force through
the unwilling green. They are often required to
retain moisture, or nourishment, for the future blossom
through long times of drought; and this they
do in bulbs underground, of which some become a
rude and simple, but most wholesome food for man.</p>

<p>"Then the <i>Drosidæ</i> are divided into five great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
orders&mdash;lilies, asphodels, amaryllis, irids and rushes.
No tribes of flowers have had so great, so varied, or
so healthy an influence on man as this great group
of <i>Drosidæ</i>, depending not so much on the whiteness
of some of their blossoms, or the radiance of
others, as on the strength and delicacy of the substance
of their petals; enabling them to take forms
of faultless, elastic curvature, either in cups, as the
Crocus, or expanding bells, as the true Lily, or heath-like
bells, as the Hyacinth, or bright and perfect
stars, like the Star of Bethlehem, or, when they are
affected by the strange reflex of the serpent nature
which forms the labiate group of all flowers, closing
into forms of exquisitely fantastic symmetry as
the Gladiolus. Put by their side their Nereid sisters,
the Water-lilies, and you have in them the origin
of the loveliest forms of ornamental design and the
most powerful floral myths yet recognized among
human spirits, born by the streams of the Ganges,
Nile, Arno and Avon.</p>

<p>"For consider a little what each of those five
tribes has been to the spirit of man. First, in their
nobleness; the Lilies gave the Lily of the Annunciation;
the Asphodels, the flower of the Elysian
Fields; the Irids, the fleur-de-lys of chivalry; and
the Amaryllis, Christ's lily of the fields; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Rush, trodden always under foot, became the
emblem of humility. Then take each of the tribes
and consider the extent of their lower influence.
<i>Perdita's</i> 'the Crown Imperial, lilies of all kinds,'
are the first tribe, which, giving the type of perfect
purity in the Madonna's Lily, have, by their lovely
form, influenced the entire decorative design of Italian
sacred art; while ornament of war was continually
enriched by the curves of the triple petals of
the Florentine '<i>giglio</i>' and the French fleur-de-lys;
so that it is impossible to count their influence for
good in the Middle Ages, partly as a symbol of
womanly character and partly of the utmost brightness
and refinement in the city which was the 'flower
of cities.'"</p>

<p>Astrologers placed the lily under the moon; and
the flower is certainly dreamy enough and celestial
enough to be under the rule of Diana, or Astarte.</p>

<i>Crown-Imperial and Flower-de-luce</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">THE CROWN-IMPERIAL</span> (<i>Fritillaria imperalis</i>)
is mentioned by <i>Perdita</i>. A native of
Persia, Afghanistan, and Kashmir, it was taken to
Constantinople, and thence to Vienna in 1576.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Finally it came to England with other luxuries of
the Renaissance. Gerard had it in his garden, and
describes it as follows:</p>

<p>"Out of a tuft of narrow leaves the stem rises
and terminates in a second tuft immediately below
which is a ring of large tulip-like flowers, pendulous
and golden yellow. Looking into the bells at the
base of every petal is a white and concave nectary
from which hangs a drop of honey that shines like
a pearl. In the bottom of each of the bells there
is placed six drops of most clear shining water, in
taste like sugar resembling in shew fair Orient
pearls, the which drops if you take away there do
immediately appear the like. Notwithstanding if
they may be suffered to stand still in the flower according
to his own nature, they will never fall away,
no, not if you strike the plant until it be broken."</p>

<p>The Crown-Imperial was, perhaps, of all choice
"outlandish flowers" the choicest. Parkinson gives
it the first place in the Garden of Delight, opening
his great book, "Paradisus Terrestris," with an account
of it:</p>

<p>"The Crown Imperial," he writes, "for his stately
beautifulness deserveth the first place in this our
Garden of Delight. The stalk riseth up three, or
four, foot high, being great, round and of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>purplish color at the bottom, but green above, beset
from thence to the middle thereof with many long
and broad green leaves of our ordinary white lily,
but somewhat shorter and narrower, confusedly
without order, and from the middle is bare, or naked,
without leaves for a certain space upwards, and then
beareth four, six, or ten flowers, more or less, according
to the age of the plant and the fertility of the
soil where it groweth. The buds at the first appearing
are whitish, standing upright among a bush, or
tuft, of green leaves, smaller than those below and
standing above the flowers. After a while they turn
themselves and hang downward every one upon his
own footstalk, round about the great stem, or stalk,
sometimes of an even depth and other while one
lower, or higher, than another, which flowers are
near the form of an ordinary Lily, yet somewhat
lesser and closer, consisting of six leaves of an
orange-color striped with purplish lines and veins,
which add a great grace to the flowers. At the bottom
of the flower, next unto the stalk, every leaf
thereof hath on the outside a certain bunch, or
eminence, of a dark purplish color, and on the inside
there lieth in those hollow bunched places certain
clear drops of water like unto pearls, of a very sweet
taste, almost like sugar. In the midst of each flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
is a long white stile, or pointell, forked, or divided,
at the end and six white chives, tipt with yellowish
pendants, standing close above it. After the flowers
are past, appear six square seed vessels, standing
upright, winged as it were, or weltered on the edges,
yet seeming but three-square, because each couple
of those welted edges are joined closer together,
wherein are contained broad, flat and thin seeds of a
pale brownish color, like unto other lilies, but much
greater and thicker also.</p>

<p>"This plant was first brought from Constantinople
into these Christian countries, and, by relation of
some that sent it, groweth naturally in Persia. It
flowereth most commonly in the end of March, if
the weather be mild, and springeth not out of the
ground until the end of February, or beginning of
March, so quick it is in the springing. The head
with seeds are ripe in the end of May. It is of some
called <i>Lilium Perticum</i>, or Persian Lily; but because
we have another, which is more usually called
by that name, I had rather, with Alphonsus Pancius,
the Duke of Florence, his physician (who first sent
the figure thereof unto Mr. John de Brancion) call
it <i>Corona Imperialis</i>, the Crown Imperial."</p>

<p class="caption center half">MARTAGON LILIES, WARLEY, ENGLAND</p>
</div>

<p>There is a legend that the Crown-Imperial grew
in the garden of Gethsemane, where it was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
admired by Jesus Christ. At that time, according
to the story, the flowers were <i>white</i> and erect on the
stalk. During the night of the agony when Our
Lord passed through the garden, this flower was the
only one that did not bow its head. Later the proud
flower bent its head and tears of sorrow filled its cup.
Ever since that time the plant has continued to bow
in sorrow and its tears flow forever.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes Watson loves the flower with its "bold,
decided outlines." His description is all too short.
"The tall stem," he says, "rises like a mast through
the lower leaves, is thence for a short space bare till
it is topped by the crowning sheaf of leaf-swords,
out of which droop so gracefully the large yellow
wax-like bells. Here every line seems to pierce like
an arrow, the composition is so clear and masterly."</p>

<p>The Crown-Imperial appears in the celebrated
book called "Guirlande de Julie," which the Duc de
Montausier gave on New Year's Day, 1634, to his
bride, Julie de Rambouillet. This was a magnificent
album: every leaf bore a beautifully painted
flower and a verse descriptive of it or in praise
of it contributed by different artists and poets.
Chapelain chose the Crown-Imperial for his theme,
pretending that it sprang from the blood of Gustavus
Adolphus of Sweden, who, not being able to offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
his hand to Julie, came to her in the guise of this
flower.</p>

<p><span class="lb">FLOWER-DE-LUCE</span> (<i>Iris pseudacorus</i>). <i>Perdita's</i>
mention of "lilies of all kinds, the flower-de-luce
being one," shows that Shakespeare classed this
flower among the lilies. So did the botanists of his
time. Symbol of eloquence and power, the Egyptians
placed the purple iris upon the brow of the
Sphinx. The scepter of their monarchs was adorned
with this flower, its three petals representing faith,
wisdom, and valor. The kings of Babylon and
Assyria also bore it on their scepters. The Greeks
laid the iris on the tombs of women because they
believed that Iris guided dead women to the Elysian
Fields. Although the iris was also dedicated to
Juno, it is more particularly the flower of Iris, lovely
Iris, one of the beautiful Oceanides, daughters of
Ocean, and messenger of the gods, who whenever she
wished to descend upon the earth threw her rainbow
scarf across the sky and with all its prismatic colors
glistening in her perfumed wings descended from
heaven to earth upon the graceful bow that joins
the seen and the unseen worlds. The purple, yellow,
orange, and blue tints of the rainbow live again
in the petals and drooping lips called "falls." What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
a flower of charm, mystery, and majesty! Sphinx
of the flower world! The iris was extremely popular
in Shakespeare's day. Parkinson gives a great
many "Flower-de-luces, or Iris" in his monumental
work. We find "the Purple, the Blue, the Purple-striped,
the Peach-colored, the White, the White-striped,
the Parti-colored, the Milk-White, the Silver
color, the White with Yellow Falls, the Straw
color, the Spanish Yellow, the Purple and Yellow,
the Purple or Murrey, the Great Turkie, the Common
Purple, the Great Dalmatian, the Yellow of
Tripoli, the Double Blew, the Double Purple, the
Purple Dwarf," and many others which prove how
popular this flower was in Tudor and Stuart gardens,
and what splendid specimens were known to
the people of Shakespearian times. Parkinson also
adds: "The dried root called Orris is of much use
to make sweet powders, or other things, to perfume
apparel or linen."</p>

<p>The fleur-de-lis early became the symbol of
France. At the proclamation of a new king the
Franks always placed a living flower, or flag, as it
was called, in his hand as the symbol of power. Because
his wife, St. Clotilde, had a vision of the iris,
Clovis erased the three frogs on his shield and sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>stituted
the iris. In consequence also of a dream,
Louis VII took the iris for his device in 1137, from
which it became known as the fleur de Louis, later
contracted into fleur-de-lys and fleur-de-lis. When
Edward III claimed the crown of France in 1340,
he quartered the Old French shield bearing the fleur-de-lis
with his English lion. The iris, or flower-de-luce
(as the English wrote it), did not disappear
from the English coat of arms until 1801.</p>

speech in "King Henry VI":<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<h2><a name="IVc" id="IVc"></a>IV<br />
<i>Fern and Honeysuckle</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">THE FERN</span> (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>), with its graceful
and beautifully indented leaves and its peculiar
acrid scent, delicious to many persons, would be admitted
into the Shakespeare garden because of its
fantastic qualities, even if its beauty did not sue
for recognition. The fern is a fairy plant. According
to folk-lore it always blossomed at twelve o'clock
on St. John's eve (June 21), Midsummer night.
The flower is described as a wonderful globe of
sapphire blue (according to other stories a ruby/red);
and in a few moments after its blossoming the
seed appeared. <i>Oberon</i>, the fairy king, was supposed
to watch for the precious seed so that he might
prevent mortals from obtaining it; but any one
fortunate enough to gather fern-seed would be under
the protection of spirits, and would be enabled to
realize all his fondest desires. Furthermore, any
one who wore the fern-seed about him would be invisible.
Shakespeare was familiar with this superstition,
for he makes <i>Gadshill</i> exclaim in "King
Henry IV":<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> "We steal as in a castle, cock-sure:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
we have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_56" id="Footnote_55_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Part I, Act II, Scene I.</p></div>

<p>An old account tells us:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="medium">The fern flowers on Midsummer night at twelve o'clock,
and drives away all unclean spirits. First of all it puts
forth buds, which afterwards expand, then open, and
finally change into flowers of a dark red hue. At midnight
the flower opens to its fullest extent and illuminates everything
around. But at that precise moment a demon plucks
it from its stalk. Whoever wishes to procure this flower
must be in the forest before midnight, locate himself near
the fern and trace a circle around it. When the Devil
approaches and calls, feigning the voice of a parent, sweetheart,
etc., no attention must be paid, nor must the head be
turned; for if it is, it will remain so. Whoever becomes the
happy possessor of the flower has nothing to fear; by its
means he can recover lost treasure, become invisible, rule on
earth and under water and defy the Devil.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because the fern was so powerful against evil
and because it was sacred to St. John the Baptist,
witches detested it.</p>

<p>Pliny stated that the fern had neither flower nor
seed; and some of the old English writers believed
this. William Turner, however, went to work to
investigate matters. In his famous "Herbal," published
in 1562,<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> he says:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_57" id="Footnote_56_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> See <a href="#Page_34">p. 34.</a></p></div>

<p>"Not only the common people say that the fern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>hath seed, but that was also the opinion of a Christian
physician named Hieronymus Tragus, who doth
not only say that the fern hath seed, but writeth
that he found upon Midsummer Even seed upon
brakes.<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Although all they that have written of
herbs have affirmed and holden that the brake doth
neither seed nor fruit, yet have I divers times proved
the contrary, which thing I will testify here in this
place for their sakes that be students of herbs. I
have, four years together, one after another, upon
the Vigil of St. John the Baptist, which we call in
English Midsummer Even, sought for this seed of
brakes upon the night; and, indeed, I found it early
in the morning before day-break. The seed was
small, black, and like unto poppy. I went about
this business all figures, conjurings, saunters, charms,
witchcraft, sorceries, taking with me two or three
honest men. When I sought this seed all the village
about did shine with bonfires that the people
made there; and sometime when I sought the seed
I found it, and sometimes I found it not. Sometime
I found much and sometime I found little; but
what should be the cause of this diversitie, or what
Nature meaneth in this thing, surely I cannot tell."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>And truly this is one of
"the sweetest flowers for scent that blows." It takes
its name because of the honey dew found on it, so old
writers say. Romantic is its other name, "woodbine,"
suggesting sylvan spots and mossy beds,
where cool-rooted flowers grow, such as the "nodding
violet." Shakespeare knew what he was about
when he enwreathed and entwined <i>Titania's</i> canopy
with "luscious woodbine" in loving union with the
equally delicious eglantine. The honeysuckle is a
flower that belongs particularly to moonlight and to
fairy-time.</p>

<p>A bower covered with the intense, yet subtle, perfume
of the honeysuckle, doubly sweet in the hot
sun that had ripened the blossoms and drawn out
their inmost sweetness, was just the place to send
"saucy Beatrice" for the purpose of lighting the
flame of love for <i>Benedick</i>, and just the place to
send, a little later, the cynical <i>Benedick</i> for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>pose
of awakening his interest in the "Lady Disdain."
Shakespeare evidently knew that the honeysuckle
is the flower of ardent lovers, and so he
framed his pleachèd bower with these sweet-scented
blossoms. The French have a tender name for the
flower, <i>cher feu</i> (dear flame), because it is given by
lovers to one another. The other French name,
<i>chèvre feuille</i>, is derived from the Latin <i>caprifolium</i>
(goat-leaf), which may have been given to it because
the plant leaps over high rocks and precipices,
where only goats and others of the cloven-footed
tribe dare venture. The honeysuckle in Shakespeare's
day was a favorite remedy for wounds in
the head. Witches also valued it for their sorcery.
According to sorcerers and astrologers this plant was
under the rule of Mercury.</p>

<p>It is hard to decide when the honeysuckle is at its
best. Whether at hot noontide when the clusters of
pale buff and white horns of plenty tipped with their
long, feathery threads pour their incense into the
golden sunlight, or when the less pungent, but
equally intoxicating, perfume floats upon the silvery
blue air of a moonlit night.</p>

<p>"How sweetly smells the Honeysuckle, in the
hush'd night as if the world were one of utter peace
and love and gentleness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Landor has thus expressed what the delicious
honeysuckle makes us feel.</p>

<p>"The monthly honeysuckle," writes Celia Thaxter,
"is most divine. Such vigor of growth I have
never seen in any other plant. It climbs the trellis
on my piazza and spreads its superb clusters of
flowers from time to time all summer. Each cluster
is a triumph of beauty, flat in the center and curving
out to the blossoming edge in joyous lines of loveliness,
most like a wreath of heavenly trumpets
breathing melodies of perfume to the air. Each
trumpet of lustrous white deepens to a yellower tint
in the center where the small ends meet; each blossom
where it opens at the lips is tipped with fresh
pink; each sends out a group of long stamens from
its slender throat like rays of light; and the whole
circle of radiant flowers has an effect of gladness
and glory indescribable: the very sight of it lifts
and refreshes the human heart. And for its odor,
it is like the spirit of romance, sweet as youth's
tender dreams. It is summer's very soul."</p>

<p>Enchanting season of fern and honeysuckle, perfumed
stars that shine through green leaves and
bells that send forth peals of incense instead of
sound!</p>

<i>Carnations and Gilliflowers</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">CARNATIONS</span> (<i>Dianthus caryophyllus</i>). <i>Perdita</i>
calls carnations and streak'd gilliflowers "the
fairest flowers o' the season." Carnation was originally
spelled coronation, because the flower was used
to make crowns, garlands, and wreaths. In the days
of Pliny it was called <i>dianthus</i>, or flower of Jove,
and was also worn in wreaths and crowns. From
Chaucer we know that it was cultivated as the
"Clove Gilliflower" in English gardens; and because
it was used to add a spicy flavor to wine and
ale, it acquired the popular name of "sops in wine."
Hence Spenser in his "Shepherd's Calendar" sings:</p>

<p>"Its second specific name," writes Ellacombe,
"<i>Caryophyllus</i>, i.e., nut-leaved, seems at first very
inappropriate for a grassy-leaved plant; but the
name was first given to the Indian Clove tree and
from it transferred to the Carnation on account of
its fine clove scent. Its popularity as an English
plant is shown by its many names&mdash;Pink, Carnation,
Gilliflower (an easily-traced and well-ascertained
corruption, from <i>Caryophyllus</i>), Clove
Picotee<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and Sops-in-wine from the flowers being
used to flavor wine and beer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_61_62" id="Footnote_61_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> From the French <i>picot</i>, a pinked edge. We still use the word
"pinked" for a cut edge, and "pinking-iron" is the word for that
with which the edge is cut.</p></div>

<p>"There is an historical interest also in the flowers.
All our Carnations, Picotees and Cloves came originally
from the single <i>Dianthus caryophyllus</i>. This
is not a true British plant; but it holds a place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the English flora, being naturalized on Rochester
and other castles. It is abundant in Normandy;
and I found it in 1874 covering the old castle of
Falaise, in which William the Conqueror was born.
I have found that it grows on the old castles of
Dover, Deal and Cardiff, all of them of Norman
construction, as was Rochester, which was built by
Gandulf, the special friend of William. Its occurrence
on these several Norman castles makes it
very possible that it was introduced by the Norman
builders, perhaps as a pleasant memory of their
Norman homes, though it may have been incidentally
introduced with the Norman (Caen) stone,
of which parts of the castles are built. How soon
it became a florist's flower we do not know; but it
must have been early, for in Shakespeare's time the
sorts of Cloves, Carnations and Pinks were so many
that Gerard says: 'A great and large volume would
not suffice to write of every one at large in particular,
considering how infinite they are, and how every
year, every climate and country bringeth forth new
sorts and such as have not heretofore been written
of.'"</p>

<p>Parkinson speaks of "Carnations, Pinks and Gilloflowers."
"The number of them is so great," he says,
"that to give several descriptions to them were end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>less."
He therefore mentions a few favorites.
Among the Carnations we find the Great Harwich,
or old English Carnation; the Red, or Clove Gilloflower;
the Yellow, or Orange Tawny Gilloflower;
the Gray Hulo; the Red Hulo; the Blue Hulo; the
Grimelo, or Prince; the White Carnation, or Delicate;
the French Carnation; the Crystal, or Chrystalline;
the Fragrant; the Striped Savage; the Oxford
Carnation; the King's Carnation; the Granado;
the Grand Père; and the Great Lombard. His Gilliflowers
include the Lustie Gallant, or Westminster;
the Bristow Blue; the Bristow Blush; the Red
Dover; the Fair Maid of Kent, or Ruffling Robin;
the Queen's Gilloflower; the Dainty; the Brassill
Gilloflower; the Turkie Gilloflower; the Pale
Pageant; the Sad Pageant; Master Bradshawe his
Dainty Lady; John Witte his great Tawny Gilloflower;
the Striped Tawny; the Marbled Tawny;
Master Tuggie his Princess; the Feathered Tawny;
and Master Tuggie his Rose Gilloflower. The
Tuggies had a superb garden at Westminster in
which they made a specialty of Carnations, Gilliflowers,
and Pinks. The flower upon which Parkinson
spends his most loving description is the Great
Harwich. The enthusiasm of this old flower-fancier,
who writes so delightfully, makes us feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>that the Great Harwich is an English institution,
just as important as the Roast Beef of Old England
or the English Plum Pudding.</p>

<p class="caption center half">A GARDEN OF DELIGHT</p>
</div>

<p>"I take this goodly great old English Carnation,"
he writes, "as a precedent for the description of all
the rest, which for his beauty and stateliness is
worthy of a prime place. It riseth up with a great
thick, round stalk divided into several branches
somewhat thickly set with joints, and at every joint
two long green (rather than whitish) leaves, turning,
or winding, two or three times round. The
flowers stand at the tops of the stalks in long great
and round green husks, which are divided into five
points, out of which rise many long and broad
pointed leaves, deeply jagged at the ends, set in
order, round and comely, making a gallant, great
double Flower of a deep Carnation color, almost red,
spotted with many blush spots and streaks, some
greater and some lesser, of an excellent soft, sweet
scent, neither too quick, as many others of these
kinds are, nor yet too dull; and with two whitish
crooked threads, like horns, in the middle. This
kind never beareth many flowers; but as it is slow
in growing, so in bearing, not to be often handled,
which showeth a kind of stateliness fit to preserve
the opinion of magnificence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>What a delightful idea Parkinson gives of the
conscious dignity of the flower! How vividly he
brings the Great Harwich before us and makes us
love its green husk, its mottled leaves, its rich scent,
and its curling horns!</p>

<p>"Gilloflowers," Parkinson continues, "grow like
unto Carnations, but not so thick set with joints and
leaves. The stalks are more, the leaves are narrower and
whiter, for the most part, and in some, do as
well a little turn.<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The flowers are smaller, yet very
thick and double in most; and the green husks in
which they stand are smaller likewise. The ends
of the leaves are dented and jagged. Some also have
two small white threads, crooked at the ends like
horns in the middle of the flower; others have none.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_62_63" id="Footnote_62_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> "Do a little turn" is charming, suggesting a quaint little waltz.</p></div>

<p>"Most of our later writers do call them by one
general name, <i>Caryophyllus sativus</i> and <i>Flos
Caryophyllus</i>, adding thereto <i>maximus</i> when we
mean Carnations, and <i>major</i> when we would express
Gilloflowers, which name is taken from Cloves
in that the scent of the ordinary red Gilloflower especially
doth resemble them. Divers other several
names have been formerly given them, as <i>Vetonica</i>,
or <i>Betonia altera</i> or <i>Vetonica altibus</i> and <i>coronaria</i>,
<i>Herba Tunica</i>, <i>Viola Damascena</i>, <i>Ocellus Damascenus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>and <i>Barbarieus</i>. Of some <i>Cantabrica Pliny</i>.
Some think they were unknown to the Ancients and
some would have them be <i>Iphium</i> of Theophrastus,
whereof he maketh mention in his sixth and seventh
chapters of his sixth book among garland and summer
flowers; others to be his <i>Dios anthos</i> or <i>Louis
flos</i>. We call them in English, the greatest kinds,
Carnations, and the other Gilloflowers (quasi July
Flowers). The Red, or Clove, Gilloflower is most
used in physic in our apothecaries' shops (none of
the others being accepted, or used) and is accounted
to be a very cordial."</p>

<p>Some writers say that the gilliflower was a cure
for pestilential fevers. Gerard writes: "Conserve
made of the flowers of the Clove Gilloflower and
sugar is exceeding cordial and wonderfully above
measure, doth comfort the heart, being eaten now
and then."</p>

<p>The Italian painter, Benvenuto Tisio, always
painted a gilliflower in the corner of his pictures
as his emblem, from which he is always called <i>Il
Garofalo</i>.</p>

<p>The word "pink" is derived from the Dutch word
<i>Pinkster</i> (Whitsuntide), the season a certain "Whitsuntide
Gilliflower" was in bloom. The pink was
regarded as an antidote for epilepsy; and a vinegar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
made of pinks was used as a valued remedy for the
plague. The Elizabethans also thought "if a conserve
be composed of it, it is the life and delight of
the human race."</p>

<p>Our old friend Parkinson describes Pinks as
"wild, or small, Gilloflowers, some bearing single
and some double flowers, some smooth, almost without
any deep dents on the edges, and some jagged,
or, as it were, feathered. Some growing upright,
like unto Gilloflowers, others creeping, or spreading,
some of one color, some of another, and many of
divers colors."</p>

<p>He gives Double and Single Pinks, Feathered or
Jagged Pinks, Star Pinks, Great Sea Gilloflower,
or Great Thrift, "often used in gardens to empale
or border a knot, because it abideth green in Winter
and Summer and that by cutting it may grow thick
and be kept in what form one list." We also find
Single Red Sweet John, Single White Sweet John;
Double Sweet John; Single Red Sweet William;
Double Red Sweet William; Speckled Sweet William,
or London Pride; Deep Red, or Murrey Color,
Sweet William; and Single White Sweet William.</p>

<p>"These," he adds, "are all generally called
<i>Armerius</i> or <i>Armeria</i>, yet some have called them,
<i>Vetonica agrestis</i> and others <i>Herba Tunica</i>, <i>Scar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>latea</i>
and <i>Carophyllus silvestris</i>. We do in English,
in most places call the first, or narrower-leaved
kinds, Sweet Johns and all the rest Sweet Williams;
yet in some places they call the broader-leaved
kinds that are not spotted <i>Tolmeiners</i> and
London Tufts; but the speckled kind is termed by
our English Gentlewomen, for the most part, London
Pride. We have not known of any of these
used in physic."</p>

<p>These spicy pinks and luscious July flowers and
the simple Sweet-Johns and Sweet-Williams as well
recall the lovely lines of Matthew Arnold:</p>

of lyrics:</p>

<p>"The Marygold," says Lyte, "hath pleasant,
bright and shining yellow flowers, the which do close
at the setting down of the Sun and do spread and
open again at the Sun rising."</p>

<p>And Lupton writes: "Some do call it <i>Spousa Solis</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>the Spowse of the Sun, because it sleeps and
is awakened with him."</p>

<p>In "The Rape of Lucrece" Shakespeare also mentions
the flower:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her eyes, like marigolds, hath sheathed their light</span><br />
<span class="i0">And canopied in darkness sweetly lay</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till they might open to adorn the day.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Very prettily the flower is introduced in Middleton
and Rowley's "Spanish Gipsy":</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You the Sun to her must play,</span><br />
<span class="i0">She to you the Marigold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To none but you her leaves unfold.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another old English name for the marigold was
ruddes and a prettier one was the gold-flower, often
called simply the gold or goold. Chaucer talks of
"yellow Goldes." The name was still used in Elizabeth's
day. "Colin Clout" has:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if I her like ought on earth might read,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I would her liken to a crown of lilies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon a Virgin bride's adorned head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With roses dight and goolds and daffodillies.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Medieval times the monks gave to the gold-flower
the prefix Mary, with the legend that the
Virgin Mary loved to wear the flower in her bosom.
Hence Shakespeare calls it "Mary-buds." Of Shakespeare's
Marigolds Parkinson writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are called <i>Caltha</i> of divers and taken to
be that <i>Caltha</i> whereof both Virgil and Columella
have written. Others do call them <i>Calendula of
the Kalends</i>, that is the first day of the months,
wherein they are thought chiefly to flower. And
thereupon the Italians call them <i>Fiori di ogni mese</i>,
that is the Flowers of Every Month. We call them
in English generally Golds, or Marigolds.</p>

<p>"The herb and flowers are of great use with us
among other pot-herbs, and the flowers, either green
or dyed, are often used in possets, broths and drinks;
as a comforter of the heart and spirits; and to expel
any malignant, or pestilential quality, gathered near
thereunto. The Syrup and Conserve made of the
fresh flowers are used for the same purpose to good
effect."</p>

</a>
<p class="caption center half">SIR THOMAS MORE'S GARDEN, CHELSEA</p>
</div>

<p>Parkinson divides marigolds unto two classes:
single and double.</p>

<p>"The garden Marigold," he says, "hath round
green stalks, branching out from the ground into
many parts, whereon are set long, flat green leaves,
broader and rounder at the point than anywhere
else. The flowers are sometimes very thick and
double (breaking out of a scaly, clammy green
head), composed of many rows of leaves, set so close
together, one within another, that no middle thrum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>can be seen; and sometimes less double, having a
small brown spot of a thrum in the middle; and
sometimes but of two or three rows of leaves with
a large brown thrum in the middle: every one whereof
is somewhat broader at the point and nicked in
two or three corners, of an excellent fair, deep,
gold-yellow color in some, and paler in others, and
of a pretty strong and resinous sweet scent.</p>

<p>"There is no difference between this and the single
Marigold but that the flowers are single, consisting
of one row of leaves of the same color; either paler
or deeper yellow, standing about a great brown
thrum in the middle. Our gardens are the chief
places for the double flowers to grow in."</p>

<p>Another description is contained in the famous
"Gardener's Labyrinth" by Didymus Mountain
(Thomas Hill):<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>"The Marigold, named of the herbarians <i>Calendula</i>,
is so properly termed for that in every Calend
and in each month this reneweth of the own accord
and is found to bear flowers as well in Winter as
Summer, for which cause the Italians name the same
the flower of every month. But some term it the
Sun's Spowse, or the follower of the Sun; and is of
some named the Husbandman's Dial, in that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
same showeth to them both the morning and evening
tide. Others name it the Sun's Bride and
Sun's Herb, in that the flowers of the same follow
the Sun as from the rising by the South into the
West; and by a notable turning obeying to the Sun,
in such manner that what part of Heaven he possesseth
they unto the same turned behold, and that
in a cloudy and thick air like directed, as if they
should be revived, quickened and moved with the
spirit of him. Such is the love of it knowen to be
toward that royal Star, being in the night time for
desire of him as pensive and sad, they be shut or
closed together; but at the noontime of the day fully
spread abroad as if they with spread arms longed,
or diligently attended, to embrace their Bridegroom.
This Marigold is a singular kind of herb, sown in
gardens as well for the pot as for the decking of
garlands, beautifying of Nosegays and to be worn in
the bosom."</p>

<p>The Marigold is supposed to be the Chrysanthemum
or gold-flower of the Greeks, the <i>Heliotrope-solsequium</i>;
and the story goes that the flower was
originally the nymph Clytie, who gazed all day upon
the Sun with whom she had fallen in love. At
length she was turned into the flower. "All yellow
flowers," said St. Francis de Sales, "and above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
those that the Greeks call Heliotrope and we call
Sunflower, not only rejoice at the sight of the sun,
but follow with loving fidelity the attraction of its
rays, gazing at the Sun and turning towards it from
its rising to its setting."</p>

of Shakespeare, refer to this:</p>

<p>Margaret of Orleans, grandmother of Henri IV,
knowing well the legend of the flower, chose for her
device a marigold with the motto, <i>je ne veux suivre
que lui seul</i>.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII the marigold was often
called "Souvenir" and sentimental ladies wore
wreaths of marigolds mixed with the heartsease. To
dream of marigolds denoted prosperity, riches, success,
and a happy and a wealthy marriage. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
marigold was a solar flower, the astrologers placed
it under the sign and care of Leo.</p>

<p>The Shakespearian marigold must not be confused
with the French marigold (<i>Flos Africanus</i>),
called also Indian gilliflower, flower of Africa, and
flower of Tunis. A long chapter on this marigold
appears in Parkinson's book. This is the tightly
rolled up little flower of irregular ragged petals,
but of a rich, deep golden hue.</p>

<p>Parkinson also speaks of the great Peruvian sunflower,
which he admires greatly and describes with
enthusiasm. We know it well as our common sunflower
with its dark center and yellow rays&mdash;a
magnificent specimen of the floral world, worthy of
the adoration of the Incas and of more than we
usually accord to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lb">LARKSPUR</span> (<i>Delphinium</i>). "Lark's-heels trim,"
one of the flowers in the introductory song of
"The Two Noble Kinsmen," is the Delphinium,
also called larkspur, lark's-claw, lark's-toes, and
knight's-spur. The generic name is derived from
the Greek <i>delphinium</i>, because the buds were
thought to resemble the form of a dolphin.</p>

<p>As with many other plants, there were two kinds,
the "wild" and the "tame"; and it was the wild
kind that was "nourished up in gardens," according
to Parkinson, who describes the plant as having
"small, long, green leaves, finely cut, almost like
fennel and the branches ending in a long spike of
hollow flowers with a long spur behind them. They
are of several colors: bluish purple, or white, or ash
color, or red, paler or deeper, and parti-colored of
two colors in a flower.</p>

<p>"They are called diversely by divers writers as
<i>Consolida regulis</i>, <i>Calearis flos</i>, <i>Flos regius</i>, <i>Buccinum
Romanorum</i>, and <i>Cuminum silvestre alterum
Dioscoridis</i>; but the most usual name with us is
<i>Delphinium</i>. But whether it be the true <i>Delphinium</i>
of Dioscorides, or the Poet's Hyacinth, or the Flower
of Ajax, another place is fitter to discuss than this.
We call them in English Larks-heels, Larkspurs,
Larkstoes, or claws, and Monks-hoods. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
use of any of these in Physicke in these days that I
know, but are wholly spent for their flowers sake."</p>

<p>A modern botanist remarks:</p>

<p>"The gardener's ideal has been the full-flowered
spike with a goodly range of colors on the chord of
blue. We think of larkspur as blue. Some of these
blues are pale as the sky, some pure cobalt, others
indigo and still others are a strange broken blue,
gorgeous and intense, yet impure, glittering on the
surface as if it were strewn with broken glass, and
sometimes darkened into red. The center of a larkspur
is often grotesque; the hairy petals suggest a
bee at the heart of a flower, and the flower itself
looks like a little creature poised for flight. In
structure the garden race has changed very little
from the primitive type, though that type has wandered
far from the simplicity of the buttercup, which
names the <i>Ranunculacæ</i>. Whatever path of evolution
the larkspur has trod, it is very clear that the
goal at which it has arrived is cross-fertilization by
means of the bee. At some time along the path the
calix took on the duties of the corolla, became highly
colored, developed a spur, while at the same time
the corolla lessened both in size and in importance.
The stamens mature before the pistil and are so
placed that the bee cannot get at the honey without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
covering its head with pollen which it then bears to
another flower."</p>

<p>The name of Monk's-hood is also given to the
Blue Helmet-flower, or aconite.<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Yellow Lark's-heels is a name our Elizabethan
forefathers gave to the <i>Nasturtium Indicum</i>, a plant
found in the West Indies and taken by the early
Spanish explorers to Spain, whence it traveled to
all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>"It is now very familiar in most gardens of any
curiosity," says Parkinson. "The likeness of this
flower, having spurs, or heels, is of so great beauty
and sweetness withall that my Garden of Delight
cannot be unfurnished of it. The flowers are of an
excellent gold yellow color and grow all along the
stalks. In the middle of each of the three lower
leaves there is a little long spot, or streak, of an
excellent crimson color, with a long heel, or spur,
behind, hanging down. The whole flower hath a
fine small scent, very pleasing, which, being placed
in the middle of some Carnations, or Gilloflowers
(for they are in flower at the same time), make a
delicious Tussiemussie, as they call it, or Nosegay,
both for sight and scent. Monardus and others call
it <i>Flos sanguineus</i> of the red spots in the flower, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
also <i>Nastnerzo de las Indias</i>, which is <i>Nasturtium
Indicum</i>; and we thereafter in English, Indian
Cresses. Yet it may be called from the form of the
flowers Yellow Lark's heels."</p>

<p>This flower is phosphorescent and is said to emit
sparks, which are visible in the dark.</p>

<i>Pansies for Thoughts and Poppies for Dreams</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">PANSY</span> (<i>Viola tricolor</i>). "Pansies&mdash;that's for
thoughts," exclaims <i>Ophelia</i>, as she holds out
the flower that the French call <i>pensée</i> (thought).
And it is the pansy that is "the little western flower"
upon which "the bolt of Cupid fell" and made
"purple with love's wound" and which "maidens
call Love in Idleness,"&mdash;the flower that <i>Oberon</i>
thus described to <i>Puck</i> when he sent him to gather it.
The juice of it squeezed by <i>Oberon</i> upon <i>Titania's</i>
eyelids and by <i>Puck</i> upon the Athenian youths and
maidens, who were also sleeping in the enchanted
wood on that midsummer night, occasioned so many
fantastic happenings.</p>

<p>The pansy in those days was the small Johnny-Jump-Up,
a variety of the violet, according to the
old writers, "a little violet of three colors, blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
white and yellow." Milton noted that it was
"freaked with jet." Michael Drayton showed its
close relationship to the violet in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The pansy and the violet here</span><br />
<span class="i21">As seeming to descend</span><br />
<span class="i0">Both from one root and very fair</span><br />
<span class="i21">For sweetness yet contend.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gerard wrote in 1587:</p>

<p>"The stalks are weak and tender, whereupon
grow flowers in form and figure like the Violet and
for the most part of the same bigness, of three sundry
colors, whereof it took the surname Tricolor, that
is to say purple, yellow and white, or blue; by reason
of the beauty and bravery of which colors they
are very pleasing to the eye, for smell they have little,
or none at all."</p>

<p>The pansy was beloved of Elizabethans: the great
number of popular names it had proves this. In
addition to Pansy and Johnny-Jump-Up, it was
called Herb Trinity, because of the three distinct
petals, which made it a flower of peculiar religious
significance. Another name was Three-Faces-under-a-Hood
because it had such a coquettish air.
Another name was Fancy Flamey, because its amethystine
colors are like those seen in the flames of
burning wood; and because lovers gave it to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
another it had the pet names of Meet-me-at-the-Garden-Gate,
Kiss-me-at-the-Garden-Gate, Kiss-me-quick,
Kiss-me, Call-me-to-you, Cuddle-me-to
you, Kiss-me-ere-I-rise, Pink-of-my-John, Cupid's-flower,
Love-in-Idleness, and Heartsease.</p>

<p>There were no "wine dark pansies" in Shakespeare's
time to charm the lover of flowers and none
of the splendid deep purple velvets and mauves and
pale amethysts and burnt orange and lemon and
claret and sherry and canary hues that delight us
to-day, and which are, to use the quaint old expression,
"nourished up in our gardens." The modern
beauties began to be developed about 1875, chiefly
by the French specialists, and, as a modern writer
remarks:</p>

<p>"Such sizes, such combinations, such weirdness
of expression in quaint faces painted upon the petals
were never known before. The colors now run a
marvellous range; pure-white, pure yellow, deepening
to orange, and darkening to brown, as well as a
bewildering variety of blues and purples and violets.
The lowest note is a rich and velvety shade that we
speak of as black; but there is no black in flowers.</p>

<p>"The pansy is the flower for all. It is cheap; it is
hardy; it is beautiful; and its beauty is of an unusual
and personal kind. The bright, cheerful, wist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>ful
or roguish faces look up to you with so much
apparent intelligence that it is hard to believe it is
all a pathetic fallacy and there is nothing there."</p>

<p>Whether the modern pansies should be included
in a Shakespeare garden is a question for each owner
of a garden to decide; but there should certainly be
a goodly number of the little "Johnny-Jump-Ups."</p>

<p><span class="lb">POPPY</span> (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>). Shakespeare
introduces the poppy only indirectly when he
speaks of the "drowsy syrup" in "Othello." The
white poppy is the flower from which the sleeping
potion was made. "Of Poppies," says Parkinson,
"there are a great many sorts, both wild and tame;
but our garden doth entertain none but those of
beauty and respect. The general known name to all
is <i>Papaver</i>, Poppie. Yet our English gentlewomen
in some places call it by name Joan's Silver Pin.
It is not unknown, I suppose, to any that Poppies
procureth sleep." Other old names for the poppy
were Corn Rose and Cheese Bowl.</p>

<p>Scarlet poppies in the wreath of Ceres among the
wheat-ears, scarlet poppies mingled with large
white-petaled daisies, and Ragged Robins belong to
everybody's mental picture of midsummer days.</p>

<p>"We usually think of the Poppy as a coarse
flower," says Ruskin, "but it is the most transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and delicate of all the blossoms of the field. The
rest, nearly all of them, depend on the texture of
their surface for color. But the Poppy is painted
glass; it never glows so brightly as when the sun
shines <i>through</i> it. Whenever it is seen against the
light, or with the light, always it is a flame and
warms in the wind like a blown ruby."</p>

<p>"Gather a green Poppy bud, just when it shows
the scarlet line at its side, break it open and unpack
the Poppy. The whole flower is there compact in
size and color, its stamens full grown, but all packed
so closely that the fine silk of the petals is crushed
into a million of wrinkles. When the flower opens,
it seems a relief from torture; the two imprisoning
green leaves are shaken to the ground, the aggrieved
corolla smooths itself in the sun and comforts itself
as best it can, but remains crushed and hurt to the
end of its days."</p>

<p>Delicate and fine as is the above description, the
sympathetic tribute to the poppy by Celia Thaxter
does not suffer in proximity. She says:</p>

<p>"I know of no flower that has so many charming
tricks and manners, none with a method of growth
more picturesque and fascinating. The stalks often
take a curve, a twist from some current of air, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
some impediment, and the fine stems will turn and
bend in all sorts of graceful ways, but the bud is
always held erect when the time comes for it to
blossom. Ruskin quotes Lindley's definition of what
constitutes a poppy, which he thinks 'might stand.'
This is it: 'A Poppy is a flower which has either four
or six petals and two or more treasuries united in
one, containing a milky stupefying fluid in its stalks
and leaves and always throwing away its calix when
it blossoms.'</p>

<p>"I muse over their seed-pods, those supremely
graceful urns that are wrought with such matchless
elegance of shape and think what strange power they
hold within. Sleep is there and Death, his brother,
imprisoned in those mystic sealed cups. There is a
hint of their mystery in their shape of somber
beauty, but never a suggestion in the fluttering blossom:
it is the gayest flower that blows. In the more
delicate varieties the stalks are so slender, yet so
strong, like fine grass stems. When you examine
them, you wonder how they hold even the light
weight of the flower so firmly and proudly erect; and
they are clothed with the finest of fine hairs up and
down the stalks and over the green calix.</p>

<p>"It is plain to see, as one gazes over the poppy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>-beds
on some sweet evening at sunset, what buds will
bloom in the joy of next morning's first sunbeams,
for these will be lifting themselves heavenward,
slowly and silently, but surely. To stand by the
beds at sunrise and see the flowers awake is a
heavenly delight. As the first long, low rays of the
sun strike the buds, you know they feel the signal!
A light air stirs among them; you lift your eyes,
perhaps to look at a rosy cloud, or follow the flight
of a carolling bird, and when you look back again,
lo! the calix has fallen from the largest bud and
lies on the ground, two half-transparent light green
shells, leaving the flower-petal wrinked in a thousand
folds, just released from their close pressure.
A moment more and they are unclosing before your
eyes. They flutter out on the gentle breeze like
silken banners to the sun."</p>

<p>It would be tempting in a Shakespeare garden to
include many kinds of this joyous, yet solemn,
flower; and certainly as many were common in Elizabethan
gardens it would not be an anachronism to
have them. However, if the space be restricted and
the garden lover a purist then the white poppy only
should be planted.</p>

<i>Crow-flowers and Long Purples</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">CROW-FLOWERS</span> (<i>Scilla nutans</i>). These are
among the flowers <i>Ophelia</i> wove into a wreath. The
queen tells the court:</p>

<p>Shakespeare did not select <i>Ophelia's</i> flowers at
random. They typified the sorrows of the gentle
victim of disappointed love whose end was first madness,
then suicide. The crow-flowers signified "fair
maiden"; the nettles, "stung to the quick"; the
daisies, "her virgin bloom"; and the long purples,
"under the cold hand of Death." Thus what Shakespeare
intended to convey by this code of flowers
was, "A fair maiden, stung to the quick, her virgin
bloom in the cold hand of Death."</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the wild blue
hyacinth, or harebell (<i>Scilla nutans</i>), a flower asso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>ciated
with pure and faithful love, is the crow-flower;
and authority is given to this theory in the
old ballad, which, of course, Shakespeare knew,
called "The Deceased Maiden Lover":</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Then round the meddowes did she walk</span><br />

<span class="i0">And as she pluckt them still cried she,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Alas! there's none ere loved like me."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some critics have objected to the blue harebell
because it is a spring flower, and it is midsummer
when <i>Ophelia</i> drowns herself. These authorities
suggest the Ragged Robin for <i>Ophelia's</i> crow-flower,
and others again the buttercup, also called creeping
crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>). Bloom writes:</p>

<p>"It is generally assumed that the flowers are those
of the meadow and that a moist one. Why? It is
equally probable they are those of the shady hedge
bank and that the crow-flowers are the poisonous
rank <i>Ranunculus reptans</i> and its allies; that the
nettles are the ordinary <i>Urtica dioica</i> not necessarily
in flower, or if this be objected to on account of the
stinging qualities which the distraught <i>Ophelia</i>
might not be insensible to, its place could be taken
by the white dead nettle <i>Lamium album L.</i> The
daisies may be moon-daisies and the long purples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><i>Arum masculatum</i>, another plant of baleful influence,
with its mysterious dead white spadix bearing
no very far fetched resemblance to a dead man's
finger wrapped in its green winding-sheet and whose
grosser name, cuckoo-pint, is ready at hand. With
this selection we have plants of the same situation
flowering at the same time and all more or less baneful
in their influence."</p>

<i>Saffron Crocus and Cuckoo-flowers</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">SAFFRON CROCUS</span> (<i>Crocus verus sativus
Autumnalis</i>). Shakespeare speaks of saffron as a
color&mdash;"the saffron Wings of Iris" and "saffron to
color the Warden [pear] pies." He never mentions
the crocus from which the saffron was obtained, yet
a Shakespeare garden should have this plant represented.
Saffron had long been known in England;
for in the time of Edward III a pilgrim from the
East had brought, concealed in his staff, a root of the
precious Arabic <i>al zahafaran</i>. In Shakespeare's
time saffron was used for soups and sauces and to
color and flavor pies, cakes, and pastry-confection.
Saffron was also important medicinally, and for
dyeing silks and other materials. The beautiful
orange-red stigmas, the <i>crocei odores</i> of Virgil, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
dried and the powder pressed into cakes and sold in
the shops.</p>

<p>"The true saffron," writes Parkinson, "that is
used in meats and medicines, shooteth out his narrow
long green leaves first, and, after a while, the
flowers, in the middle of them, appear about the
end of August, in September and October, according
to the soil and climate where they grow. These
flowers are composed of six leaves apiece, of a murrey,
or reddish purple color, having a show of blue
in them. In the middle of these flowers there are
some small yellow chives standing upright, which
are unprofitable; but, besides these, each flower hath
two, three, or four greater and longer chives hanging
down, upon, or between, the leaves, which are of a
fiery red color and are the true blades of saffron
which are used physically, or otherwise, and no
other."</p>

<p>The raising of saffron was a great industry. Old
Tusser gave the good advice to</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Saffron Walden in Essex and Saffron Hill in
London received their names because of the quantity
of saffron crocus grown in those places.</p>

<p>The saffron crocus is a handsome flower, but somewhat
capricious. Dr. Forbes Watson writes:</p>

<p>"We look at the few well selected flowers in our
hand and let our mind wander in the depths of those
fair-striped cups, their color so fresh, so cool, so
delicate, and yet not too cool, with that central yellow
stamen-column and the stigma emerging from it
like a fiery orange lump. The Purple Crocus, partly
from the full materials for color-contrast afforded
by its interior, partly from the exceeding delicacy
of tint, the lilac stripes and markings, the transparent
veins and the pale watery lake which lies at
the bottom of the cup, seem to bear us away to some
enchanted spot, a fairy-land of color where no
shadow ever falls&mdash;a land of dim eternal twilight
and never fading flowers. Note, too, the differences
between the Crocuses with regard to the stigma. In
the Purple Crocus, where it is needed to complete
the harmony of the flower, it rises long and flame-tipped
out of the tall bundle of yellow stamens.
Notice also the curve of the outside of the Purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Crocus cup in a well-selected flower, and observe
how quiet and solemnly beautiful it is in perfect
harmony with the general expression."</p>

<p>According to legend, the flower derived its name
from a beautiful youth, Crocus, who was transformed
into the flower. His love, Smilax, was
changed at the same time into the delicate vine of
that name. Another legend says that the flower
sprang from the blood of the infant Crocus, who
was accidentally killed by a disk thrown by the god
Mercury. The Egyptians encircled their wine-cups
with the saffron crocus; the Greeks and Romans
adorned the nuptial couch with the saffron crocus;
the robes of Hymen, god of marriage, were saffron-hued;
and poets called the dawn saffron, or crocus-colored.
Shakespeare, therefore, had authority for
"the saffron wings of Iris."</p>

<p>Saffron is an herb of the sun and is under the rule
of Leo.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's cuckoo-flower is identified as the
Ragged Robin, so called from its finely cut blue
petals which have a ragged appearance. It is also
known as the meadow campion, or Meadow Pink.
Parkinson says: "Feathered Campions are called
<i>Armoraria pratensis</i> and <i>Flos cuculi</i>. Some call
them in English Crow-flowers and Cuckowe Flowers,
and some call the double hereof The Fair Maid of
France."</p>

<p>From the above we see why it is that the Ragged
Robin has been identified by some authorities as
<i>Ophelia's</i> crow-flower; for even Parkinson seems to
consider the crow-flower and cuckoo-flower as identical.
Some of the old herbalists give the name
cuckoo-flower to the lady-smock, which is called
cuckoo-buds. The cuckoo's name is given to many
flowers: we have the cuckoo-flower, cuckoo-buds,
cuckoo's-bread (wood-sorrel), cuckoo's-meat,
cuckoo-pint (<i>Arum maculatum</i>), cuckoo-grass;
cuckoo-hood (blue corn-flower), etc. The cuckoo-flower
(Ragged Robin) is dedicated to St. Barnabas.</p>

<i>Pomegranate and Myrtle</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">THE POMEGRANATE</span> (<i>Punica</i>) is a regal
flower. Its burning beauty appeals to every one who
loves color, for the scarlet of the pomegranate has a
depth and a quality that is all its own. The crinkled
silken petals, rising from a thick, red calix and set off
by bright green leaves of wondrous glossy luster and
prickly thorns, delight those who love beauty.
Moreover, there is something luscious and strange
about the pomegranate that makes us think of Oriental
queens and the splendors of Babylon and Persia,
ancient Egypt and Carthage. It is a flower that
Dido might have worn in her hair, or Semiramis in
garlands around her neck!</p>

<p>Shakespeare knew perfectly well what he was
doing when he placed a pomegranate beneath
<i>Juliet's</i> window, amid whose leaves and flowers the
nightingale sang so beautifully. The pomegranate
was exactly the flower to typify the glowing passion
of the youthful lovers.</p>

<p>"There are two kinds of pomegranate trees,"
writes Parkinson, "the one tame or manured, bearing
fruit; the other wild, which beareth no fruit, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>cause
it beareth double flowers, like as the Cherry,
Apple and Peach-tree with double blossoms.</p>

<p>"The wild Pomegranate (<i>Balustium maius sive
Malus Punica</i>) is like unto the tame in the number
of purplish branches, having thorns and shining fair
green leaves, somewhat larger than the former.
From the branches likewise shoot forth flowers far
more beautiful than those of the tame, or manured,
sort, because they are double, and as large as a
double Province Rose, or rather more double, of an
excellent bright crimson color, tending to a silken
carnation, standing in brownish cups or husks, divided
at the brims usually into four, or five, several
points like unto the former, but that in this kind
there never followeth any fruit, no not in the country
where it is naturally wild. The wild, I think,
was never seen in England before John Tradescant,
my very loving good friend, brought it from the
parts beyond the seas and planted it in his Lord's
Garden at Canterbury. The rind of the Pomegranate
is used to make the best sort of writing Ink,
which is durable to the world's end."</p>

<p>The pomegranate was from the dawn of history
a favorite with Eastern peoples. It is represented
in ancient Assyrian and Egyptian sculpture and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a religious significance in connection with several
Oriental cults.</p>

<p>The tree was abundant in ancient Egypt and the
fruit was such a favorite of the Israelites that one
complaint against the desert into which Moses led
them was the charge that it was "no place of pomegranates,"
and Moses had to soothe the malcontents
by promising that the pomegranate would be among
the delights of Canaan, "a land of wheat and barley,
vines and fig-trees and pomegranates, a land of
olive oil and honey." The pomegranate was one
of the commonest fruits of Canaan, and several
places were named after it&mdash;Rimmon. The Jews
employed the pomegranate in their religious ceremonies.
On the hem of Aaron's sacred robe pomegranates
were embroidered in blue and purple and
scarlet alternating with golden bells,&mdash;an adornment
that was copied from the ancient kings of
Persia. The pomegranate was also carved on the
capitals of the pillars of the Temple of Jerusalem.
Solomon said to his bride, "I will cause thee to drink
of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranates."
There is a tradition that the pomegranate was the
fruit of the Tree of Life and that it was the pomegranate
that Eve gave to Adam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romans called it the Carthaginian apple.
The pomegranate abounded in Carthage and derives
its botanical name, <i>Punica</i>, from this place. Pliny
says that the pomegranate came to Rome from Carthage;
but its original home was probably Persia or
Babylon. It was early introduced into Southern
Europe and was taken to Spain from Africa.
Granada took its name from the fruits and the Arms
of the province display a split pomegranate. Around
Genoa and Nice there are whole hedges of it&mdash;rising
to the height sometimes of twenty feet. It
was introduced into England in Henry VIII's time,
carried there among others by Katharine of Aragon,
who used it for her device. Gerard grew pomegranates
in his garden. Many legends are connected
with the pomegranate, not the least being
that of Proserpine. When the distracted Ceres
found her daughter had been carried off by Pluto,
she begged Jupiter to restore her. Jupiter replied
that he would do so if she had eaten nothing in the
realms of the Underworld. Unfortunately, Pluto
had given her a pomegranate and Proserpine had
eaten some of the seeds. She could not return. The
sorrow of Ceres was so great that a compromise was
made and the beautiful maiden thereafter spent six
months in the Underworld with her husband and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
months with her mother above ground&mdash;a beautiful
story of the life of the seed!</p>

<p>In nearly all the legends of the East in which
the word "apple" is mentioned it is the pomegranate
that is intended. It is said to have been the fruit
presented by Paris to Venus, and it is always associated
with love and marriage.</p>

<p>In Christian art the pomegranate is depicted as
bursting open and showing the seeds. This is interpreted
as both a promise and an emblem of hope in
immortality. St. Catharine, the mystical bride of
Christ, is sometimes represented with a pomegranate
in her hand. The infant Savior is also often represented
as holding the fruit and offering it to the
Virgin: Botticelli's "Madonna of the Melagrana"
is a famous example.</p>

<p>There is also a legend that because the pomegranate
was planted on the grave of King Eteocles,
the fruit has exuded blood ever since. The number
of seeds has caused it to become the symbol of
fecundity, generation, and wealth.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MYRTLE</span> (<i>Myrtus latifolia</i>) was looked upon
in Shakespeare's time as a delicate and refined rarity,
emblem of charming beauty and denoting peacefulness,
plenty, repose, and love. Shakespeare makes
<i>Venus</i> and <i>Adonis</i> meet under a myrtle shade; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
speaks of "the soft myrtle" in "Measure for
Measure"; and he alludes "to the moon-dew on the
myrtle leaf," which is as delicate a suggestion of
the evening perfume as the "morning roses newly
washed with dew" is of the scents at dawn.</p>

<p>"We nourish Myrtles with great care," says Parkinson,
"for the beautiful aspect, sweet scent and
rarity, as delights and ornaments for a garden of
pleasure, wherein nothing should be wanting that
art, care and cost might produce and preserve.</p>

<p>"The broad-leafed Myrtle riseth up to the height
of four or five foot at the most with us, full of
branches and leaves, growing like a small bush, the
stem and elder branches whereof are covered with
a dark colored bark, but the young with a green and
some with a red, especially upon the first shooting
forth, whereon are set many fresh green leaves very
sweet in smell and very pleasant to behold, so near
resembling the leaves of the Pomegranate tree that
groweth with us that they soon deceive many that
are not expert therein, being somewhat broad and
long and pointed at the ends, abiding always green.
At the joints of the branches, where the leaves stand,
come forth the flowers upon small footstalks, every
one by itself, consisting of five small white leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
with white threads in the middle, smelling also very
sweet."</p>

<p>According to the Greeks, Myrtle was a priestess
of Venus and an especial favorite of the goddess,
who, wishing to preserve her from a too ardent
suitor, turned her into this plant, which continues
odorous and green throughout the year. Having
the virtue of creating and preserving love and being
consecrated to Venus, the myrtle was symbolic of
love. Consequently it was used for the wreaths of
brides, as the orange-blossom is to-day. Venus wore
a wreath of myrtle when Paris awarded her the
Golden Apple for beauty,&mdash;perhaps in memory of
the day when she sprang from the foam of the sea
and, wafted ashore by Zephyrus, was crowned with
myrtle by the Morning Hours! Myrtle was always
planted around the temples dedicated to Venus.</p>

<p>Rapin writes:</p>

<span class="i0">When once, as Fame reports, the Queen of Love</span><br />

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Romans always displayed myrtle lavishly
at weddings, feasts, and on all days celebrating victories.
With the Hebrews the myrtle was the
symbol of peace; and among many Oriental races
there is a tradition that Adam brought a slip of
myrtle from the Garden of Eden because he considered
it the choicest of fragrant flowers.</p>

<p>The myrtle was early loved in England. In one
of the old Roxburgh Ballads of the Fifteenth Century
a lover presses his suit by promising:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I will make the beds of Roses,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a thousand fragrant posies;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A cap of flowers and a kirtle</span><br />
<span class="i0">Embroidered with leaves of myrtle.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In those days and long afterward there was a
saying that "if you want to be sure of your myrtle
taking root, then you must spread out your dress
grandly and look proud" when you are planting
your slip. We can imagine one of the Fifteenth Century
ladies spreading her voluminous and flowing
robes with majestic grace and holding her head
adorned with the tall pointed cap, or <i>hennin</i>, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
veil fluttering from its peak as she planted the little
flower in her tiny walled Garden of Delight!</p>

<p>There is a saying, too, that one must never pass
a sweet myrtle bush without picking a spray. The
flowering myrtle is considered the luckiest of all
plants to have in the window, but it must be watered
every day.</p>

<p class="drop-cap4">ROSEMARY (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Rosemary
"delights in sea-spray," whence its
name. "The cheerful Rosemary," as Spenser
calls it, was in high favor in Shakespeare's day.
The plant was not only allowed a corner in the
kitchen-garden; but it was trained over arbors and
allowed to run over the mounds and banks pretty
much at its own sweet will. "As for Rosemarie,"
said Sir Thomas More, "I let it run all over my garden
walls, not only because my bees love it, but because
it is the herb sacred to remembrance, and,
therefore, to friendship; whence a spray of it hath a
dumb language that maketh it the chosen emblem
at our funeral-wakes and in our burial-grounds."</p>

<p><i>Ophelia</i> handed a sprig of rosemary to her brother
with the words: "There's rosemary; That's for remembrance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>pray you, love, remember." Probably
she knew the old song in the "Handful of Pleasant

<p>Rosemary was used profusely at weddings
among the decorations and the strewings on the
floor. A sprig of it was always placed in the wine
to insure the bride's happiness.</p>

<p>The herb was also conspicuous at funerals,
naturally enough as the herb was emblematic of remembrance.

<p>Most important was rosemary at Christmas-tide.
It had a place among the holly, bay, ivy, and mistletoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>to which it added its peculiar and delicious perfume.
Moreover, it was said that rosemary brought
happiness to those who used it among the Christmas
decorations.</p>

<p>Rosemary also garlanded that most important
dish of ceremony&mdash;the boar's head, which the butler
(or sewer) bore into the hall of great houses and
famous institutions, like the colleges of Oxford and
Cambridge and the City Companies, on a silver dish,
preceded by a flourish of trumpets. The carol he
sung began:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">The boar's head in hand bring I,</span><br />

<p>Lyte said: "Rosemary comforteth the brain and
restoreth speech, especially the conserve made of
the flowers thereof with sugar." Worn on the person
it was thought to strengthen the memory and
to make the wearer successful in everything. The
famous Hungary-water, so favorite a perfume in
the days of Elizabeth and after, was distilled from
rosemary. The leaves were used as a flavor in cooking
(just as the Italians use it to-day). Placed in
chests and wardrobes, rosemary preserved clothing
from insidious moth. According to astrologers,
rosemary was an herb of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"The common Rosemary (<i>Libanotis Coronaria
sive Rosmarinum vulgare</i>) is so well known," says
Parkinson, "through all our land, being in every
woman's garden, that it were sufficient to name it as
an ornament among other sweet herbs and flowers
in our gardens, seeing every one can describe it; but
that I may say something of it, it is well observed,
as well in this our Land (where it hath been planted
in Noblemen's and great men's gardens against brick
walls) as beyond the Seas in the natural places
where it groweth, that it riseth up unto a very great
height, with a great and woody stem of that compass
that, being cloven out into thin boards, it hath served
to make lutes, or such-like instruments, and here
with carpenter's rules and to divers other purposes,
branching out into divers and sundry arms that extend
a great way and from them again into many
other smaller branches whereon are set at several
distances at the joints, many very narrow long
leaves, green above and whitish underneath, among
which come forth toward the tops of the stalks,
divers sweet gaping flowers, of a pale or bleak bluish
color, many set together, standing in whitish husks.
The whole plant as well, leaves as flowers, smelleth
exceeding sweet.</p>

<p>"Rosemary is called by the ancient writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<i>Libanotis</i>, but with this difference, <i>Stephanomatica</i>,
that is <i>Coronararia</i>, because there were other plants
called <i>Libanotis</i>, that were for other uses, as this for
garlands, where flowers and sweet herbs were put
together. The Latins called it <i>Rosmarinum</i>. Some
would make it to be <i>Cueorum nigrum</i> of Theophrastus,
as they would make Lavender to be his <i>Cueorum
album</i>, but Matthiolus hath sufficiently confuted
that error.</p>

<p>"Rosemary is almost of as great use as Bays or
any other herb, both for inward and outward
remedies and as well for civil as physical purposes.
Inwardly for the head and heart; outwardly for the
sinews and joints. For civil uses, as all do know,
at weddings, funerals, etc., to bestow among friends;
and the physical are so many that you might be as
well tired in the reading as I in the writing, if I
should set down all that might be said of it."</p>

<p><span class="lb">RUE</span> (<i>Ruta graveolus</i>). Rue was a much valued
plant in Shakespeare's time. There were many
superstitions about it which seem to have been survivals
from ancient days, for rue is supposed to have
been the moly which Homer says Mercury gave to
Ulysses to withstand the enchantments of Circe.
Miraculous powers were attributed to rue: it was
said to quicken the sight, to stir up the spirits, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
sharpen the wit, to cure madness, and to cause the
dumb to speak. It was also an excellent antidote
against poison and the very smell of it insured
preservation against the plague. Rue was, therefore,
very popular and was much used as a disinfectant.</p>

<p>Parkinson tells us:</p>

<p>Garden Rue (<i>Ruta</i>), or Herbe Grace, groweth
up with hard whitish woody stalks whereon are set
divers branches of leaves being divided into many
small ones, which are somewhat thick and round
pointed, of a bluish-green color. The flowers stand
at the tops of the stalks, consisting of four small
yellow leaves, with a green button in the middle,
and divers small yellow threads about it, which
growing ripe, contain within them small black seeds.</p>

<p>"The many good properties whereunto Rue
serveth hath, I think, in former times caused the
English name of Herbe Grace to be given unto it.
For without doubt it is a most wholesome herb, although
bitter and strong. Some do wrap up a bead
roll of the virtues of Rue, as Macer the poet and
others, in whom you shall find them set down to be
good for the head, eyes, breast, liver, heart, spleen,
etc."</p>

<p>Gerard quaintly said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is reported that if a man be anointed with the
juice of rue, the bitings of serpents, scorpions, wasps,
etc., will not hurt him. When the weasel is to fight
with the serpent, she armeth herself by eating rue
against the might of the serpent."</p>

<p>Another quaint idea was that rue throve best if a
clipping from the plant was stolen from a neighbor's
garden. Like rosemary, rue was considered by the
astrologers as an herb of the sun and was placed
under the sign of Leo.</p>

<p>Rue was also called the herb of grace and the
"serving man's joy." Shakespeare frequently refers
to the herb o' grace: once in connection with salad
in "All 's Well That Ends Well."<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<i>Lavender, Mints, and Fennel</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">LAVENDER</span> (<i>Lavendula Spica</i>). "Hot lavender,"
<i>Perdita</i> calls it. Why is this? Turning to
Gerard for an explanation, we find he says: "Lavender
is hot and dry in the third degree and of a substance
consisting of many airy and spiritual parts."
Gerard had lavender in his garden and so did Parkinson,
who says:</p>

<p>"It is called of some <i>Nardus Italica</i> and <i>Lavendula</i>,
the greater is called <i>F&oelig;mina</i> and the lesser
<i>Mas</i>. We do call them generally Lavender, or
Lavender Spike, and the Lesser Spike. Lavender
is little used in physic but outwardly: the oil for
cold and benumbed parts and is almost wholly spent
with us for to perfume linen, apparrell, gloves,
leather, etc., and the dried flowers to comfort and
dry up the moisture of a cold brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our ordinary Garden Lavender riseth up with
a hard woody stem about the ground parted into
many small branches whereon are set whitish long
and narrow leaves by couples; from among which
riseth up naked square stalks with two leaves at a
joint and at the top divers small husks standing
round about them formed in long or round heads or
spikes with purple gaping flowers springing out of
each of them. The heads of the flowers are used
to be put among linen and apparrell."</p>

<p>Because of its scent, lavender was often included
in the nosegay. Lavender was much loved by sweethearts.
In the "Handful of Pleasant Delights"
(1584) it is described thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lavender is for lovers true,</span><br />
<span class="i21">Whichever more be saine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Desiring always for to have</span><br />
<span class="i21">Some pleasure for their pain.</span><br />

<span class="i0">Then have they all their perfect joy</span><br />
<span class="i21">And quenched is the fire.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lavender belongs to the crowfoot family, and therefore
is related to the columbine, buttercup, and
monk's-hood (aconite). The ancients used it in
their baths, whence the name from the Latin <i>lavare</i>,
to wash. The Elizabethans loved, as we do to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to place bags of dried lavender among the household
linen.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MINTS</span> (<i>Mentha</i>). Mints occur in <i>Perdita's</i>
list with "hot lavender, thyme and savory." Although
many kinds of mint were cultivated in gardens,
Parkinson mentions only three:</p>

<p>"The Red Mint, or Brown Mint, with dark green
nicked leaves, reddish flowers and of a reasonable
good scent; Speare Mint, greener and paler leaves,
with flowers growing in long ears, or spikes, of a
pale red, or blush, color; and Parti-colored, or
White Mint, with leaves more nicked, half white
and half green, and flowers in long heads, close set
together of a bluish color.</p>

<p>"Mints are oftentimes used in baths with Balm
and other herbs as a help to comfort and strengthen
the nerves and sinews, either outwardly applied or
inwardly drunk. Applied with salt, it is a good
help for the biting of a mad dog. It is used to be
boiled with mackerel and other fish. Being dried,
it is often and much used with pennyroyal to put
into puddings, as also among pease that are boiled
for pottage."</p>

<p>In Elizabethan days it was the custom to strew
churches with mint. In an Elizabethan play,
"Appius and Virginia," these lines occur:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">My lady's fair pew had been strewed full gay</span><br />
<span class="i0">With primroses, cowslips and violets sweet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With mints, with marigold and marjoram meek.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pliny said "the smell of mint doth stir up the
mind and taste to a greedy desire of meat." This
carries mint-sauce back into antiquity! Medieval
writers believed that the smell of mint refreshed
the head and memory; and in Medieval days the
herb was dedicated to the Virgin and called <i>Herba
Sanctæ Mariæ</i> and <i>Menthe de Notre Dame</i>. The
ancients dedicate it to Venus; hence it was used as
a garland for brides&mdash;<i>corona Veneris</i>. The old myth
had it that Menthe was a nymph beloved of Pluto
and transformed into an herb by Proserpina who had
now become sufficiently interested in the husband
who had carried her off against her will to be jealous.</p>

<p><span class="lb">FENNEL</span> (<i>F&oelig;niculum vulgare</i>). <i>Falstaff</i> speaks
of fennel as a relish for conger in "King Henry
IV";<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and <i>Ophelia</i> presents fennel to the King to
clear his sight just as she gave rosemary to <i>Laertes</i>
to refresh his memory,<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> for according to a belief held
by Pliny: "Fennel hath a wonderful property to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
mundify our sight and take away the film, or web,
that overcasteth and dimmeth our eyes."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_76" id="Footnote_75_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> "There's fennel for you and columbines" ("Hamlet"; Act IV,
Scene V).</p></div>

<p>"There are three sorts of Fennel," says Parkinson,
"whereof two are sweet." The one of them is
the ordinary sweet fennel whose seeds are larger
and yellower than the common. The other sweet
Fennel is not much known and called <i>Cardus</i> Fennel
by those that sent it out of Italy. Fennel is of
great use to trim up and strew upon fish, as also to
boil, or put among fish of divers sorts, Cowcumbers
pickled and other fruits, etc. The roots are used
with parsley roots to be boiled in broths and drinks.
The seed is much used to be put into pippin pies
and divers other such baked fruits, as also into bread
to give it the better relish.</p>

<p>"The Sweet Cardus Fennel being sent by Sir
Henry Wotton to John Tradescant had likewise a
large direction with it how to dress it, for they used
to white it after it hath been transplanted for their
uses, which by reason of the sweetness by nature
and the tenderness of art causeth it to be most delightful
to the taste, especially with them that are
accustomed to feed on green herbs."</p>

<p>Another ancient belief preserved by Pliny was
"that serpents eat fennel because it restored their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
youth by causing them to cast their old skins and
they recovered their sight by eating the plant."</p>

<p>The flowers of the fennel are yellow.</p>

<p>The Greek name for fennel is <i>marathon</i>. The
Battle of Marathon took its name from the plant.
The story goes that a youth named Pheidippides
ran to Sparta to seek aid for Athens when the Persian
fleet appeared, and he was told that the Spartans
could not come until after the full moon. Very
disheartened, he was returning to Athens when Pan
appeared to him and promised victory, giving the
youth a piece of fennel as a token of his prophecy.
The battle took place on a field full of fennel and
was known henceforth as the Battle of Marathon
(490 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>). Statues of the youth always represented
him as holding a sprig of fennel. Browning
has told the story in his "Pheidippides."</p>

<i>Sweet Marjoram, Thyme, and Savory</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">MARJORAM</span> (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) was a favorite
plant in Tudor and Stuart times. An old writer
informs us that "Sweet Marjoram is not only much
used to please the outward sense in nosegays and
in the windows of houses, as also in sweet powders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
sweet bays and sweet washing waters, but is also of
much use in physic."</p>

<p><i>Perdita</i> classes it with hot lavender and savory.<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Shakespeare, appreciating its delicate and delightful
scent, brings this out most beautifully in his
"Sonnet <span class="lb">XCIX</span>":</p>

<p>Parkinson writes:</p>

<p>"The common Sweet Marjoram (<i>Marierome</i>) is
a low herb, little above a foot high, full of branches
and small whitish, soft, roundish leaves, smelling
very sweet. At the tops of the branches stand divers
small, scaly heads, like unto knots, of a whitish
green color, out of which come, here and there, small,
white flowers, and afterward small reddish seed.
Called <i>Mariorama</i> in Latin, it is taken of most
writers to be the Amaracus, or Sampsuchum, of
Dioscorides, Theophrastus and Pliny."</p>

<p>According to the Greek myth a young man named
Amarakos was employed in the household of the
King of Cyprus. One day when he was carrying a
vase of perfumes he dropped it, and he was so much
humiliated by his carelessness that he fell and lost
consciousness. The gods then changed him into
the sweet herb <i>amarakos</i>, or <i>amaracus</i>, which is the
Greek name for this plant. Rapin thought it owed
its existence to Venus:</p>

<p><span class="lb">THYME</span> (<i>Thymus Serpyllum</i>). Thyme has always
been appreciated by those who delight in
aromatic perfume. It was one of those plants that
Lord Bacon said were so delicious when trodden
upon and crushed. Thyme was the symbol for
sweetness in Elizabethan days.</p>

<p class="pmc">
And sweet thyme true
</p>

<p>was a favorite expression. "Sweet thyme true"
occurs in connection with roses, "maiden pinks,"
and daisies in the song in "The Two Noble Kinsmen."<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_78_79" id="Footnote_78_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Act I, Scene I.</p></div>

<p>Fairies were thought to be particularly fond of
thyme, and that is one reason why Shakespeare
covered the bank where <i>Titania</i> was wont to sleep
with wild thyme. The other reason was that he
chose the sweetest flowers for perfume for the
canopy and couch of the Fairy Queen: musk-roses,
eglantine, honeysuckle, violets, and wild thyme
mingling the most delicious of scents. The word
comes from the Greek and Latin <i>thymum</i>. Thyme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
covered Mount Hymettus and gave to the honey
produced there a particularly delicious aromatic
flavor. The "honey of Mount Hymettus" became
a proverb. Hybla in Sicily was no less famed for
its thyme, and, consequently, its honey. Thyme is
especially a "bee-plant"; and those who would see
their gardens full of bees would do well to plant
thyme with lavish hand. Ladies used to embroider
a bee hovering over a sprig of thyme on the scarves
they gave to their lovers&mdash;a symbol of action and
honor. Thyme, too, was supposed to renew the
spirits of man and beast and it was deemed a powerful
antidote against melancholy.</p>

<p>Turning to our old friend, Parkinson, we find
that</p>

<p>"The ordinary garden Thyme (<i>Thymus vulgatius
sive durius</i>) is a small, low, woody plant with
brittle branches and small, hard, green leaves, as
every one knoweth, having small white purplish
flowers standing round about the tops of the stalks.
The seed is small and brown, darker than Marjoram.
The root is woody and abideth well divers Winters.</p>

<p>"To set down all the particular uses whereunto
Thyme is applied were to weary both the writer and
the reader. I will but only note out a few, for besides
the physical uses to many purposes for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>head, stomach, spleen, etc., there is no herb almost
of more use in the houses both of high and low, rich
and poor, both for inward and outward occasions,&mdash;outwardly
for bathings among other hot herbs
and among other sweet herbs for strewings. Inwardly
in most sorts of broths, with Rosemary, as
also with other faseting (or rather farsing) herbs,<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and to make sauce for divers sorts, both fish and
flesh, as to stuff the belly of a goose to be roasted
and after put into the sauce and the powder with
bread to strew on meat when it is roasted, and so
likewise on roasted or fried fish. It is held by divers
to be a speedy remedy against the sting of a bee,
being bruised and laid thereon.</p>

<p>"The wild Thyme (<i>Serpyllum hortense sive
maius</i>), growth upright, but yet is low, with divers
slender branches and small round green leaves,
somewhat like unto small fine Marjoram, and smelling
somewhat like unto it. The flowers grow in
roundels at the tops of the branches of a purplish
color. And in another of this kind they are of a
pure white color. There is another also that smelleth
somewhat like unto Musk, and therefore called
Musk Thyme, whose green leaves are not so small
as the former, but larger and longer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lb">SAVORY</span> (<i>Satureia</i>). This herb is mentioned by
<i>Perdita</i>. It was a great favorite in the old herb-garden
and was probably introduced into England
by the Romans. It is mentioned in Anglo-Saxon
recipes as "savorie." Both the winter and summer
savory were used as seasoning for dressing and
sauces. "The Winter Savory is used as a condiment
and sauce to meat, to put into puddings, sausages
and such-like kinds of meat." So says an old writer,
who continues: "Some do use the powder of the
herb dried to mix with grated bread to bread their
meat, be it fish or flesh, to give it the quicker relish."</p>

<p>Parkinson writes:</p>

<p>"The Winter Savory (<i>Satureia sive Thymbra</i>) is
a small, low, bushy herb, very like unto hyssop, but
not above a foot high, with divers small, hard
branches and hard, dark, green leaves thereon,
thicker set together than the former by so much, and
as thick as common Hyssop, sometimes with four
leaves, or more, at a joint, of a reasonable strong
scent, yet not so strong or quick as the former.
The flowers are of a pale purplish color, set at several
distances at the tops of the stalks with leaves
at the joints also with them, like the former. The
root is woody with divers small strings thereat, and
abideth all the winter with his green leaves. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
more usually increased by slipping, or dividing, the
root and new setting it, severally again in the Spring,
than by sowing the seed."</p>

<i>Sweet Balm and Camomile</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">SWEET BALM</span> (<i>Melissa officinalis</i>). Sweet

<p>The Greek and Latin names, <i>melissa</i>, <i>melissophyllum</i>,
and <i>apiastrum</i>, show that this was a bee-plant,
which was still the case in Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>"It is an herb," says Parkinson, "wherein bees do
much delight"; and he also tells us that if balm
is rubbed on the inside of the hive "it draweth others
to resort thither." He goes on to describe it as follows:</p>

<p>"The Garden Balm hath divers square blackish
green stalks and round, hard, dark, green pointed
leaves growing thereon by couples, a little notched
about the edges; of a pleasant sweet scent drawing
near to the scent of a Lemon or Citron; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>fore
of some called Citrago. The flowers grow about
the tops of the stalks at certain distances, being small
and gaping, of a pale carnation color, almost White.
The roots fasten themselves strongly on the ground
and endure many years. It is increased by dividing
the roots; for the leaves die down to the ground
every year, leaving no show of leaf or stalk in the
Winter. Balm is often used among other hot and
sweet herbs to make baths and washings for men's
bodies in the Summer time. The herb without all
question is an excellent help to comfort the heart,
as the very smell may induce any so to believe. It
is also good to heal green wounds being made into
salve. I verily think that our forefathers hearing
of the healing and comfortable properties of the true
natural Balm and finding this herb to be so effectual
gave it the name of Balm in imitation of his properties
and virtues."</p>

<p>Arabian physicians recommended balm for affections
of the heart and hypochondria.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CAMOMILE</span> (<i>Anthemis nobilis</i>). <i>Falstaff</i>
points a moral in the lowly camomile: "Though the
Camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it
grows, yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner
it wears."<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> A similar idea occurs in Lyly's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
"Euphues" (1588): "Though the Camomile the
more it is trodden and pressed down the more it
spreadeth, yet the violet the oftener it is handled
and touched, the sooner it withereth and decayeth."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Emblem of patience, the camomile was often used
to point a moral and to teach patience. In "The
More the Merrier" (1608), a character observes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Camomile shall teach thee patience,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which riseth best when trodden most upon.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Because its scent was brought out when trodden
upon, camomile was planted in and along walks and
on the edges of flower-beds. Its low growth and
delicious perfume made it a very attractive border
plant.</p>

<p>In Lawson's "New Orchard" (about 1616) there
are instructions for "Large walks, broad and long,
close and open like the Tempe groves in Thessaly,
raised with gravel and sand, having seats and banks
of Camomile: all this delights the mind and brings
health to the body."</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's day camomile grew in "the wild
field by Richmond Green."</p>

<p>"Our ordinary Camomill [says Parkinson] is well
known to all to have many small trailing branches
set with very fine small leaves and spreading thick
over the ground taking root as it spreadeth; the tops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of the branches have white flowers with yellow
thrums in the middle, very like unto the Featherfew,
but somewhat greater not so hard but more soft and
gentle in handling and the whole herb is to be of a
very sweet scent.</p>

<p>"Camomill is called <i>Anthemis Leucanthemis</i> and
<i>Leucanthemum</i> of the whiteness of the flowers; and
<i>Cham&oelig;m&oelig;lum</i> of the corrupted Italian name Camomilla.
Some call the naked Camomill <i>Chrysanthemum
odoratum</i>. The double Camomill is called by

<p><span class="lb">DIAN'S BUD</span> (<i>Artemesia</i>). This plant is nothing
more nor less than absinthe, or wormwood. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
mentioned under its poetic name by Shakespeare in
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" when <i>Oberon</i> bids
<i>Puck</i> find him the "little purple flower called Love
in Idleness," the juice of which placed on sleeping
eyelids would make man, or woman, madly dote on
the first object beheld on awakening, and with which
he intended to anoint the eyelids of the sleeping
<i>Titania</i>. He also told the mischievous sprite that
the charm could be removed with another herb&mdash;Dian's
bud, the flower sacred to the goddess Diana.
Later in the play, touching the eyes of the spellbound
fairy with this second herb, <i>Oberon</i> pronounces
the following incantation:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be as thou was wont to be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">See as thou was wont to see;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dian's bud on Cupid's flower</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hath such force and blessed power.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the earliest times absinthe was associated
with sorcery and was used for incantations. Pliny
says the traveler who carried it about him would
never grow weary and that it would drive away any
lurking devils and counteract the evil eye. Ovid
calls it <i>absinthium</i> and speaks of its bitterness.</p>

<p>The Greeks also called it <i>artemesia</i> after the goddess
Artemis, or Diana, and made it a moon-plant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Very poetically, therefore, Shakespeare alludes to
it as "Dian's Bud,"&mdash;and most appropriately does
it appear in the moon-lit forest. Gerard, however,
quaintly says that is was named for Queen Artemesia,
wife of Mausolus, King of Caria, who built the
Mausoleum, which was one of the "Seven Wonders
of the World." The ancients liked its flavor in their
wine as many people still like vermouth, one of its
infusions.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time people hung up sprays of
wormwood to drive away moths and fleas; and there
was a homely verse:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whose chamber is swept and wormwood is thrown</span><br />
<span class="i0">No flea for his life dare abide to be known.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wormwood was also kept in drawers and closets.
To dream of the plant was of good augury: happiness
and domestic enjoyment were supposed to result.
Mugwort is another old name for the plant.</p>


<p><span class="lb">MONK'S-HOOD</span> (<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>). This
plant has three names: monk's-hood, wolf's-bane,
and aconite. Aconite is the "dram of poison" that
<i>Romeo</i> calls for,<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and Shakespeare alludes to
<i>aconitum</i> in "King Henry IV," where the king, addressing
<i>Thomas of Clarence</i>, compares its strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and that of gunpowder. "Though it do work as
strong as aconitum or rash gunpowder."<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Aconite
was supposed in Elizabethan days to be an antidote
against the most deadly poison. Ben Jonson in
"Sejanus" makes one of his characters remark:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have heard that aconite</span><br />

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Bacon in "Sylva" calls <i>Napellus</i> "the most
powerful poison of all vegetables."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82_83" id="Footnote_82_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> "Romeo and Juliet"; Act V, Scene I.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_84_85" id="Footnote_84_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Act III, Scene III.</p></div>

<p>Yet despite its poisonous qualities, an English
garden lover writes, "the plant has always held, and
deservedly, a place among the ornamental plants
of our gardens; its stately habit and its handsome
leaves and flowers make it a favorite."</p>

<p>The ancients, who were unacquainted with mineral
poisons, regarded aconite as the most deadly of
all poisons and believed that Hecate had caused the
plant to spring from the venomous foam frothing
from the mouth of the three-headed dog, Cerberus,
when Hercules took him from Pluto's dark realm
on one of his Twelve Labors. Ovid describes the
aconite as</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Greece it was also known as Wolf's-bane (<i>Lycoctonum</i>),
and it was thought that arrow-heads rubbed
with it would kill wolves. Turner quaintly writes
in his "Herbal" (1568):</p>

<p>"This of all poisons is the most hastie poison,
howbeit Pliny saith this herb will kill a man if he
take it, except it find in a man something to kill.
Let our Londoners which have of late received this
blue Wolf's-bane, otherwise called Monk's Cane,
take heed that the poison of the root of this herb do
not more harm than the freshness of the flower hath
done pleasure. Let them not say but they are
warned."</p>

<p>Parkinson's name for it is <i>Napellus verus flore
c&oelig;ruleo</i> (Blue Helmet-Flower, or Monk's-hood).</p>

<p>"The Helmet Flower," he writes, "hath divers
leaves of a fresh green color on the upper side and
grayish underneath, much spread abroad and cut
into many slits and notches. The stalk riseth up
two or three foot high, beset to the top with the
like leaves, but smaller. The top is sometimes divided
into two or three branches, but more usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
without, whereon stand many large flowers one
above another, in form very like a hood, or open
helmet, being composed of five leaves, the uppermost
of which and the greatest is hollow, like unto
a helmet, or headpiece: two other small leaves are
at the sides of the helmet, closing it like cheeks, and
come somewhat under, and two other which are
the smallest hang down like labels, or as if a close
helmet were opened and some pieces hung by, of a
perfect, or fair, blue color (but grow darker having
stood long) which causeth it to be so nourished up
in Gardens that their flowers, as was usual in former
times (and yet is in many country places)
may be laid among green herbs in windows and
rooms for the Summertime; but although their
beauty may be entertained for the uses aforesaid,
yet beware they come not near your tongue or lips,
lest they tell you to your cost, they are not so good
as they seem to be. In the middest of the flower,
when it is open and gapeth wide, are seen certain
small threads like beards, standing about a middle
head, which, when the flower is past, groweth into
three or four, or more, small blackish pods, containing
in them black seeds. The roots are brownish
on the outside and white within, somewhat big and
round about and small downwards, somewhat like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
unto a small, short carrot root, sometimes two being
joined at the head together. It is the true <i>Napellus</i>
of the ancient writers, which they so termed from
the form of a turnip called <i>Napus</i> in Latin."</p>

<p>Generally speaking the leaf and flower of the
monk's-hood resemble the larkspur; and, like the
larkspur and the columbine, the plant has wandered
away from its original family, the buttercup tribe.
The upper sepal has developed from a spur into a
hood.</p>

<i>Holly and Ivy</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2">HOLLY (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>). Holly, with its
beautiful red berries and unique leaf, stiff
and prickly, but highly decorative, is the
chief emblem of Christmas. We are continuing very
ancient traditions when we hang up our Christmas
wreaths and garlands. The earliest records of the
human race contain references to the custom of
decorating houses and temples and evergreens on
occasions of rejoicing. Holly comes to us from
pagan usage. Five hundred years before the birth
of Christ the Romans had been celebrating their
midwinter festival&mdash;the Saturnalia&mdash;commemorating
the equality supposed to have existed on earth
in the golden reign of Saturn. The Saturnalia was
a period of general merry-making and relaxation.
People gave each other presents, wished each other
"Io Saturnalia," just as we wish each other "Merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Christmas," and decorated their houses and temples
with evergreens, among which holly was conspicuous.
The early Christians, who celebrated the birth
of Christ during the Saturnalia, adorned their homes
with holly for the purpose of safety. They would
have been unpleasantly noticed had they left their
homes undecorated. After a time holly became associated
with the Christian festival itself. As the
Christmas celebration spread throughout Europe
and into Great Britain, local observances naturally
became added to the original rites; and gradually
to certain features taken over from the Saturnalia
were added customs which the Germanic tribes,
the Scandinavians, the Gauls, the Celts, and early
Britons practised for the midwinter festival.
"Thus," says a modern writer, "all the pagan winter
festivals were transmuted and sanctified by the
Christian Church into the beautiful Christmas festival
that keeps the world's heart young and human.
The Church also brought from ancient observances
a number of lovable customs, such as the giving of
presents, the lighting of candles, the burning of the
Yule-log, the Boar's Head, the Christmas Tree, the
mistletoe, the holly, laurel and other greens and
the mince-pies."</p>

<p>At a season when everything was chosen to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>memorate,
or invoke, the spirit of growth, or fertility,
the holly, mistletoe and ivy&mdash;all of which
bear fruit in the winter&mdash;become particularly
precious. Beautiful, cheery holly, with its glossy,
prickly leaves and its coral bells, was a sacred plant
in the childhood of the world and will continue to
be a sacred plant as long as the world lasts. We
may make garlands of laurel or bay-leaves, we may
bind together ropes of crow's-foot or smilax, and
we may bring into our rooms pots of poinsettia; but
nothing takes, or will ever take, the place the holly
occupies in our affections. In our literature holly
is honored. It now symbolizes the spirit of Christmas
as nothing else does.</p>

<p>One of the earliest Christmas carols, dating from
the Fifteenth Century, describes a contest of Holly
and Ivy for the chief place in the hall. Holly is the
man and Ivy the woman. They have an argument
(which is a kind of duet), each setting forth his or
her claim to superiority. Finally, it is decided that
Holly, with his beautiful red berries, shall reign in
the hall instead of Ivy, whose berries are black.
Moreover, many sweet birds are attracted to Holly;
but only the owl loves Ivy.</p>

<p>Holly is, of course, the subject of many carols.
A typical one of the Fifteenth Century is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here comes Holly, that is so gent,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">To please all men is his intent,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">But lord and lady of the hall,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whosoever against Holly call,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whosoever against Holly do cry,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">In a lepe shall he hang full high.</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whosoever against Holly do sing,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span><br />
<span class="i0">He may weep and his handys wring,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Alleluia!</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the above it will be seen that it was a crime
to say a derogatory word about holly. Holly was
not only loved for its beauty but it was a holy plant.
Witches detested it and it was a charm against
their evil machinations. The name comes from the
Anglo-Saxon <i>holegn</i>. The Norse word is <i>hulf</i>, or
<i>hulver</i>; and as Chaucer calls it "Hulfeere" we may
conclude that holly was familiar to the people of
Chaucer's time under that name.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that Shakespeare has written
a song of wintry wind and holly berries to be
sung in the Forest of Arden. It affords, however, a
delightful contrast to the sun-lit summer woodland.</p>

<p><span class="lb">IVY</span> (<i>Hedera Helix</i>). Shakespeare mentions ivy

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>and in "The Tempest," when <i>Prospero</i> compares
his false brother with the ivy:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>In the old carols and plays Ivy is always represented
as a woman, and yet, although beloved, was
used for the outside decorations and doorways. Ivy
never had the place within that holly occupied.</p>

<p>As ivy clings and embraces the object near it, the
plant was chosen as an emblem of confiding love
and friendship. Tusser's commands are as follows:
"Get Ivy and Holly, women, deck up thy house."
Ivy was also used in the church decorations at Christmas-tide.
In the Middle Ages ivy was a favored and
most auspicious plant. An old carol says:</p>

<p>Ivy was the crown of the Greek and Roman poets,
whose myths proclaimed the plant sacred to Bacchus.
Indeed the plant took its name from Bacchus
(<i>kissos</i>) for it was said that the child was hidden
under ivy when abandoned by his mother, Semele.
The ivy was mingled with the grape in the crown of
Bacchus and it enwreathed his thyrsus. Ivy berries
eaten before wine was swallowed prevented intoxication,
so Pliny says. Perhaps because of its association
with Bacchus ivy was hung at the vintners'
doors in England as well as on the Continent, and a
reference to this custom is contained in Nash's
"Summer's Last Will and Testament" (1600).</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time ivy was considered a
remedy against plague, which gave another reason
for veneration.</p>

<p>England would almost cease to be England without
the ivy that so luxuriantly covers the walls of
old buildings and adds its soft beauty to the crumbling
ruins. Everybody loves it&mdash;strangers as well
as natives; and every one loves the poem that
Dickens inserted into "The Pickwick Papers":</p>

<i>Mistletoe and Box</i></h2></div>


<p><span class="lb">THE MISTLETOE</span> (<i>Viscum album</i>). The mistletoe,
the "all-healer," is a mysterious and mystical
plant. The Greeks venerated it. Virgil gave it to
Æneas for the "Golden Bough," to guide him to
the Underworld. The Scandinavians dedicated it to
their goddess of love, Freya (or Freyja). The mistletoe
is, however, more closely associated with the
Druids than with any other race. The plant was so
sacred to these strange people that it was never
allowed to touch the ground. At the New Year
the Druids marched in solemn procession into the
forest, and the high priest climbed the oak-tree and,
with a golden sickle, cut the mistletoe from the
branches. Other priests stood below holding a white
cloth to receive the mistletoe as it fell. The sacred
plant was dipped into water and then distributed
among the people, to whom it was supposed to bring
good luck of all kinds.</p>

<p>Even to-day we do not like the "Mistletoe Bough"
to fall. We say it is "unlucky"; but possibly we
have unconsciously inherited from our remote ancestors
a spark of reverence for the "Golden Bough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The Welsh thought the mistletoe "pure gold,"
believing that it had a connection with the golden
fire of the sun; and they thought also that the mistletoe
absorbed the life of the oak-tree to which it
clung.</p>

<p>The Church never sanctioned the mistletoe. It
never appears, therefore, among the Christmas decorations
in the churches. No edicts, however, were
strong enough to banish it from the decorations of
the house, and the mistletoe bough is always a feature
in the home where Christmas is celebrated with
picturesque traditions. The precise reason for hanging
up the Mistletoe Bough is lost in antiquity; but
it is possible that the particular reasons were because
it has supposed miraculous powers of healing sickness
and averting misfortune, and great potency in
promoting fertility and bestowing prosperity. For
hundreds of years the mistletoe has been reverenced
alike in castle, baronial hall, manor house and farmhouse
in Shakespeare's country and in the homes of
rich and poor in our own country.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the idea of kissing under the Mistletoe
Bough was derived from the fact that the plant
was dedicated to the Northern goddess of love. The
old saying is that the maiden who is not kissed under
the mistletoe will not be married within the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
year. The ceremony of kissing is not properly performed
unless a berry is plucked off and given with
each kiss to the maiden. When the berries are all
gone the privilege of kissing ceases.</p>

<p>That mistletoe grows on the oak-tree solely is a
popular error. In fact, the plant prefers the apple.
Most of the English mistletoe now comes from the
apple orchards of Herefordshire. Normandy sends
a great deal of mistletoe to England and to our
country. The strange parasite is also found on the
linden, poplar, and white-thorn. When once the
seed is lodged, it drives its roots deep into the branch
and draws sap and nourishment from the tree. The
European variety is known as <i>Viscum album</i> and is
much forked. In the United States the ordinary
mistletoe is known as <i>Phoradendron</i> and grows on
various hardwood trees in many of the Southern
States.</p>

<p>There is something curiously interesting about
the mistletoe. It is not beautiful, the leaves are
irregular and often stained and broken, the berries
fall almost when looked at and the plant is stiff and
woody; yet for all that there is a peculiar quality
in the greenish white and waxy berries and the shape
of the forked twig that makes us think of divining-rods
and magical words. It has a mystic fascination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
for us. Shakespeare's only reference speaks of it as
<i>baleful</i>: <i>Tamora</i> says in "Titus Andronicus":<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="lb">BOX</span> (<i>Buxus sempervirens</i>). Shakespeare mentions
the box once&mdash;when <i>Sir Toby Belch</i> and <i>Sir
Andrew Aguecheek</i> and the <i>Clown</i> are in <i>Olivia's</i>
garden and <i>Maria</i>, running out to tell them that
<i>Malvolio</i> is coming, excitedly cries:</p>

<p>Every one knows how important a feature the
box-bush is in English gardens and in the old American
gardens that were planted after English models.</p>

<p>So fine in color, so deep and luxuriant in foliage,
so dignified and aristocratic in its atmosphere the
name box is almost synonymous with old gardens.
Its acrid yet aromatic scent&mdash;most delicious after
rain&mdash;is one of its characteristics.</p>

<p>Greek myth consecrated the box to Pluto, and
the plant was said to be symbolical of the life in
the Underworld which continues all the year. The
ancients used it to border their flower-beds, and
probably the great use of box in England comes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the Roman times. The wood was used for delicate
inlay in the days of the Renaissance and also for
making musical instruments.</p>

<p>Box is thought to be the assur-wood of the Bible.
There is authority for using greenery in church decoration
for in Isaiah we read: "The glory of
Lebanon shall come unto thee; the fir-tree, the pine-tree,
and the box together to beautify the place of
my sanctuary; and I will make the places of my
feet glorious."<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>To dream of box, according to the astrologers of
Shakespeare's time, signified a happy marriage, long
life, and prosperity.</p>

<p>Box was used for decoration in the Tudor and
Stuart days and succeeded the Christmas garlands,
as Herrick sings in the time of Charles I, at Candlemas
(February 2):</p>

<p>Thus a constant succession of decorative flowers
and evergreens appeared in the houses of Old England.
Every season had its appropriate flowers, each
and all emblematical. It was also the same in the
Church. An English writer remarks:</p>

<p>"Mindful of the Festivals which our Church prescribes,
I have sought to make these objects of floral
nature the timepieces of my religious calendar and
the mementos of the hastening period of my mortality.
Thus, I can light my taper to our Virgin
Mother in the blossoming of the white Snowdrop,
Which opens its flower at the time of Candlemas;
the Lady's Smock and Daffodil remind me of the
Annunciation; the blue Harebell of the Festival of
St. George; the Ranunculus of the Invention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Cross; the Scarlet Lychnis of St. John the Baptist's
day; the White Lily of the Visitation of Our Lady;
the Virgin's Bower of the Assumption; and Michaelmas,
Martinmas, Holy Rood and Christmas have all
their appropriate decorations."</p>

<p class="ph3">THE LAY-OUT OF STATELY AND SMALL<br />
FORMAL GARDENS</p>


<h2><a name="If" id="If"></a>I<br />
<i>The Stately Garden</i></h2>


<p class="drop-cap2a">BEFORE taking any steps to make a Shakespeare
garden, it is essential to study the architectural
lines of the house and the conformation
of the grounds on which it is purposed to lay out
the garden, or series of gardens. If the grounds are
undulating, or hilly, naturally the gardens must be
arrayed on different levels. The gardens can rise
above the house in terraces if the house stands on
the side of a hill, or beneath it; or the gardens may
sink below the house, if the building crowns the
summit of an elevation. On the other hand, if the
house is erected on a flat plain, the gardens can
open out like a series of rooms partitioned off by
hedges, arbors, or walls. An artistic eye and resourceful
mind will prefer to take advantage of the
natural lines and work out a plan suggested by them.
With nearly every kind of house the square garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
accords, either perfectly square or longer than broad.
Frequently the small enclosed garden looks well at
the side of the house. It is essential to call in the
professional gardener for advice regarding the situation
of the garden, and questions of drainage, sunshine,
and exposure to winds and sunshine; for all
these matters aid in determining the arrangement. If
a series of gardens is planned, one leading from another,
it is well to consider them as outside rooms.
In this case there will be little trouble in making
the lay-out. The simplest plan is always the most
effective. A very good example to follow is the lay-out
of Montacute, Somersetshire, built in 1580-1601:</p>

<p>"Before the house is a walled-in forecourt, and
in the forecourt a small lawn with a fountain, or
pool, in the center. An entrance-gate leads into the
forecourt. Before this forecourt comes a small antecourt,
designed for the sake of dignity. On one side
of the forecourt is the base, or bass, court, surrounded
by the stables, kitchens, and other buildings;
and on the other side is the ornamental
pleasure-grounds, including 'my lady's garden,' a
survival of the small enclosed castle garden, of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus35">
<img src="images/fig40.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center half">GARDEN HOUSE IN OLD ENGLISH GARDEN</p>
</div>

<p>"Overlooking the garden is the Terrace&mdash;twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>or thirty feet wide&mdash;of considerable length, and protected
by a balustrade of detached banisters, of
handsome design pierced in stone. From the Terrace
wide flights of steps at either end lead to the broad
sanded walks that divide the parterre into several
subdivisions, which are again divided by narrow
paths into smaller designs.</p>

<p>"The general shape is square, following the
antique classical garden of Pliny's time, enclosed
with trellis-work, espaliers, clipped box-hedges,
statuary, fountains, vases, and pleached alleys."</p>

<p>The famous Nonsuch, near Ewell, in Surrey, laid
out by Henry VIII toward the end of his life, retained
its appearance for more than a hundred years;
for at the time of the Parliamentary Survey (1650)
it was thus described:</p>

<p>"It was cut out and divided into several allies,
quarters and rounds, set about with thorn hedges;
on the north side is a kitchen garden, very commodious
and surrounded with a brick wall of fourteen
feet high. On the west is a wilderness severed from
the little park by a lodge, the whole containing ten
acres. In the privy garden were pyramids, fountains
and basins of marble, one of which is set round with
six lilack trees, which trees bear no fruit, but a very
pleasant flower. Before the Palace is a neat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
handsome bowling-green surrounded with a balustrade
of freestone."</p>

<p>Hampton Court Gardens, so beautiful to-day,
were very famous in Tudor times. The old manor
house was at the southwest corner of the area, and
around it Cardinal Wolsey laid out his gardens and
orchards. In 1599 Henry VIII seized the estate
and enlarged the gardens. Ernest Law exclaims:</p>

<p>"What a truly delightful picture must these gardens
have formed with their little walks and parterres,
sheltered arbors and banquetting-houses. The
largest plot was called the King's New Garden and
occupied the place called the Privy Garden. Here
were the gay parterres with gravel paths and little
raised mounds with sun-dials on them. Here was
also the Pond Garden, which is still to be seen and
which, though much altered, yet retains something
of its Tudor aspect; and another, known as the
Little Garden, which may, perhaps, be identified
with the enclosed space at the side of the Pond Garden.
Studded about in various parts of the gardens
and orchards were heraldic beasts on pedestals, holding
vanes, or shields, bearing the King's Arms and
badges; also many brass sun-dials."</p>

<p>Another typical garden was that of Kenilworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
known, of course, to Shakespeare, as it is in Warwickshire:</p>

<p>"His Honor's the Earl of Leicester's exquisite
appointment of a beautiful garden, an acre or more
in quantity, that lieth on the north. Whereon all
along the Castle wall is reared a pleasant terrace,
ten feet high and twelve feet broad, even under foot
and fresh of fine grass, as is also the side, thereof,
towards the garden, in which, by sundry equal distances
with obelisks and spheres and white bears
all of stone upon their curious bases by goodly shew,
were set. To these, two fine arbors, redolent by
sweet trees and flowers, at each end, one; the garden-plot
under that, with fair alleys, green by grass, even
voided from the borders on both sides, and some
(for change) with sand, smooth and firm, pleasant
to walk on, as a sea-shore when the water is avoided.
Then much gracified by due proportion of four even
quarters, in the midst of each upon a base of two
feet square and high, seemingly bordered of itself, a
square pilaster rising pyramidically fifteen feet
high."</p>

<p>Thus Robert Laneham wrote in a letter describing
the pageant at Kenilworth in 1575.</p>

<p>The garden of varying ascents and descents was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
much admired in Elizabethan days. Sir Henry
Wotton (1568-1630), a most sensitive critic, who
wrote so beautifully of flowers, describes in his "Elements
of Architecture" a garden laid out on different
levels:</p>

<p>"I have seen a garden for the manner perchance
incomparable into which the first access was a high
walk like a terrace, from whence might be taken a
general view of the whole Plot below. From this,
the Beholder, descending many steps, was afterwards
conveyed again by several mountings and
fallings to various entertainments of his scent and
sight. Every one of these diversities was as if he
had been magically transported into a new garden."</p>

<p>The above extracts will afford suggestions for the
lay-out of fine stately gardens. The most typical
Elizabethan estates are Montacute, Somersetshire;
Longleat, Wiltshire; Hatfield, Hardwicke, Kirby,
Penshurst, Kent; and Drayton House, Northamptonshire.
All of these are models for imitation in
our own country.</p>

<i>The Small Garden</i></h2></div>


<p>Turning now to the small enclosed garden, first
select your ground, your design, and your flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
for borders, edging, and knots, so that you will know
the effect you wish to produce.</p>

<p>"Making a garden," says H. H. Thomas, "may
be likened to painting a picture. Just as the artist
has before him the landscape which he is to depict
on the canvas, the gardener should have in his mind's
eye a strong impression of the kind of garden he
wishes to make. There is nothing like being
methodical even in gardening, so it is best to materialize
one's ideas in the form of a rough sketch,
or plan."</p>

<p>Show your gardener the diagram and have him
stake off your garden and beds with the greatest
accuracy. Your walks, paths, and beds must be
<i>exact</i>. Next select your style of enclosure and
build your brick wall, plant your green hedge, or
construct your pleached alley. Each one has its
own particular advantages and charm. The brick
wall forms a shelter for plants that love shade and
a fine support for climbing plants, especially ivy.
The hedge makes a rich and distinguished wall of
living green, which can be artistically clipped; and
arches can be made through it. The pleached alley,
formed of wooden trellis, lattice-work, or rustic, or
wire arches painted an attractive color, or left in
the natural wood, will, if they are covered profusely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
with roses, honeysuckle, rosemary, and other roving
flowers, give the effect of the old leafy tunnels of
greenery and blossoms.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IIIf" id="IIIf"></a>III<br />
<i>Soil and Seed</i></h2></div>


<p>Every gardener of olden times, as well as every
practical worker to-day, insists upon the necessity
of digging and trenching and preparing the soil before
any seeds are sown, or cuttings planted. For
this important preparation, the advice of the best
local gardener is imperative.</p>

<p>Regarding seeds it is interesting to seek advice
from Didymus Mountain's "The Gardener's
Labyrinth." "Every gardener and owner," he says,
"ought to be careful and diligently to foresee that
the seeds committed to the earth be neither too old,
dry, thin, withered, nor counterfeited, but rather
full, new and full of juice.</p>

<p>"After the seeds being workmanly bestowed in
the beds, the gardener's next care must be that he
diligently pull up and weed away all hurtful and
unprofitable herbs annoying the garden plants
coming up."</p>

<p>All very sound advice, quaintly expressed. Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Didymus is even quainter as he tells of the astrological
influences:</p>

<p>"The daily experience is to the gardener as a
schoolmaster to instruct him how much it availeth
and hindereth that seeds to be sown, plants to be
set, yea, scions to be grafted (in this or that time),
having herein regard, not to the time especially of
the year, as the Sun altereth the same, but also to
the Moon's increase and wane, yea, to the sign she
occupieth, and places both about and under the
earth. To the aspects also of the other planets,
whose beams and influence both quicken, comfort,
preserve and maintain, or else nip, wither, dry, consume,
and destroy by sundry means the tender seeds,
plants, yea, and grafts; and these after their property
and virtue natural or accidental."</p>

<p>Then he goes on to say:</p>

<p>"To utter here the popular help against thunder,
lightnings and the dangerous hail, when the tempest
approacheth through the cloud arising, as by the
loud noise of guns shot here and there, with a loud
sound of bells and such like noises which may happen,
I think the same not necessary, nor properly
available to the benefit of the garden.</p>

<p>"The famous learned man, Archibus, which wrote
unto Antiochus, King of Syria, affirmeth that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
tempests shall not be harmful to plants, or fruit, if
the speckled toad, enclosed in a new earthern pot,
be buried in the middle of the garden."</p>

<p>A modern authority says:</p>

<p>"While no hard and fast rule can be made, a general
practice is to cover seeds with double their own
depth of soil under glass and four times their own
depth of soil when sowing in the open ground. To protect
seeds from cats, bury several bottles up to
the neck in seed bed and put in each bottle a teaspoonful
of liquid ammonia."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IVf" id="IVf"></a>IV<br />
<i>The Gateway</i></h2></div>


<p>The gate entrance was always important in Tudor
times. The gate, usually of pierced ironwork, but
also of wood artistically cut into balusters, was hung
between two square piers of brick or stone, about
ten feet apart. Each pier was surmounted by a stone
ball, with or without necking, unless heraldic lions,
bears, wyverns, or other emblems of the owner were
used. The piers were, as a rule, two feet square
and nine, or ten, feet to the top of the cornice. Gateways
were also set in walls, and little gates were set
in hedges, or flanked by ornamental shrubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Vf" id="Vf"></a>V<br />
<i>The Garden-House</i></h2></div>


<p>The garden-house was very important in Shakespeare's
time. It was often a substantial edifice,
built of brick or stone, placed at the corner of a
boundary, or dividing wall, so as to afford a view
of more than one part of the garden. Sometimes
two buildings were constructed, one at each corner,
as at Montacute. Another favorite position was
at the end of a long walk ending in a vista; and
another was overlooking the bowling-alley, from
which visitors could watch the game. The garden-house
was often fitted with handsome woodwork
and even a fireplace. An outside staircase sometimes
led to the roof.</p>

<p>The summer-house arbor was also often made of
wooden lattice-work and covered with vines. Sometimes
it was hollowed out of the clipped hedge, or
out of a large tree properly shaped by the toparian
artist. The gazebo, built at the corner of a wall
overlooking the garden within and the road without,
was also a popular kind of summer-house. The
origin of the name is still obscure. Some people say
it comes from the same root as to gaze, and refers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to viewing the scenery; but there is a suggestion of
the Orient in the word. The gazebo may best be
described as a kind of wall pavilion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VIf" id="VIf"></a>VI<br />
<i>The Mount</i></h2></div>


<p>The mount, originally intended to enable persons
to look over the enclosing wall, served both as a
place to enjoy the view and as a post of outlook in
time of danger. Mounts were constructed of wood
or stone, curiously adorned within and without.
They were also made in the old barrow shape of
earth and covered with grass. The top of the
mount was often adorned with a summer-house, or
arbor. The mount at Hampton Court, constructed
in 1533 on a brick foundation, was the first specimen
of its day; and the arbor upon it was a very
elaborate affair, made of wooden pales and trellis-work.
Sometimes the mount, instead of being a
raised and detached mound, was formed like a long
bank raised against an outer wall.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VIIf" id="VIIf"></a>VII<br />
<i>Rustic Arches</i></h2></div>


<p>"Rustic arches should be in keeping with the
house and grounds. Firstly they should be in keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>ing
with the style of the house and grounds. A
white stone house with a light pillared verandah is
not suited by rustic arches: it requires to be seen
through vistas made up of arches as slender as the
verandah pillars, of painted iron-work preferably,
and the most telling contrast will be arranged if
there are numerous deep evergreen shrubs.</p>

<p>"Rustic, or peeled oak, arches suit the modern
red brick villa style of house to perfection; the
trellis arch, being neat and unpretentious, is also in
excellent taste. The old-fashioned country cottage,
or the house built to imitate it, should not have
trellis-work within half a mile. Rustic arches, or invisible
ones of bent iron, are alone in keeping. By
an invisible arch, I mean one consisting of a single
bend of iron, or narrow woodwork upright with a
cross bar&mdash;anything really that is intended only to
support some evergreen climber or close grower, such
as a rose that will hide the foundation at all seasons.</p>

<p>"Arches simply built of rustic poles are more
pleasing than wire or lattice ones in any landscape;
and the roughness of the wood is beneficial to the
climbers that grow over them, affording an easy
hold for tendrils. Whether the wood is peeled, or
employed with the bark on&mdash;the latter is the more
artistic method&mdash;it is an admirable plan to wash it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
all over with a strong solution of some insecticide
and then give one or two coats of varnish. In most
cases varnish alone is enough to preserve the wood.</p>

<p>"The use of rustic wood in a garden is always
safe since its appearance cannot conflict with Nature
as painted woodwork when present in excess is sure
to do. From woodcutter's yards, especially those
in the heart of the country, charming pieces of log
of any size can be bought very cheaply and whenever
a tree on an estate has to be felled portions of
its trunks or branches can be turned to good account
in the garden."<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

add brightness and elegance to the scene.</p>

<i>Fountains</i></h2></div>


<p>In Elizabethan gardens the fountain was a familiar
feature, and fountains were very elaborate
with regard to their construction.</p>

<p>Bacon says:</p>

<p>"For fountains they are a great beauty and refreshment:
the one that sprinkleth or spouteth
water; the other, a fair receipt of water of some
thirty or forty foot. For the first, the ornaments of
images gilt, or marble, which are in use, do well.
Also some steps up to it and some fine pavement
about doth well. As for the other kind of fountain,
which may be called a bathing-pool, it may admit
much curiosity and beauty, as that the bottom be
finely paved, and with images; the sides likewise and
withal embellished with colored glass and such
things of luster encompassed also with fine rails of
low statues."</p>

<p>Hentzner saw three famous fountains on his visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to England in 1592, at Hampton Court, Whitehall,
and Nonsuch. He describes the one at Hampton
Court as follows:</p>

<p>"In the middle of the first and principal court
stands a fountain, splendid, high, and massy, with
an ingenious water-work, by which you can, if you
like, make the water to play upon the ladies and
others who are standing by and give them a thorough
wetting."</p>

<p>The one at Whitehall was also capable of playing
practical jokes:</p>

<p>"A <i>jet d'eau</i> with a sun-dial, which, while strangers
are looking at it, a quantity of water forced by a
wheel, which the gardener turns at a distance
through a number of little pipes, plentifully
sprinkles those who are standing round."</p>

<p>More ornate was the fountain at the superb palace
of Nonsuch in Surrey:</p>

<p>"In the pleasure and artificial gardens are many
columns and pyramids of marble, two fountains that
spout water, one round the other like a pyramid
upon which are perched small birds that stream
water out of their bills. In the Grove of Diana is a
very agreeable fountain with Actæon turned into
a stag, as he was sprinkled by the goddess and her
nymphs with inscriptions. There is besides another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
pyramid of marble full of concealed pipes which
spirt upon all who come within their reach."</p>

<p>In the small formal garden a fountain looks well
at the intersection of the paths in the center of the
quarters. It is not necessary to have an ornate fountain,
for the real charm of a fountain consists in the
upward plume of spray that glistens in the sunshine,
that turns to pearls in the moonlight, and that always
charms the eye of man and delights the neighboring
flowers with its spray blown by the breeze.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<i>The Dove-cote</i></h2></div>


<p>Every manor-house had its dove-cote, or columbary,
as it was called. Here doves and pigeons aided
in making a very pretty picture as they flew in and
out of the architecturally designed bird-house. The
right to keep them was confined to the lords of the
manor, and the law was very strictly enforced.</p>

<p>Andrew Borde tells us that a dove-house is a
necessary thing about a mansion-place. It is, therefore,
quite proper to include a bird-house in the
Shakespeare garden; and a pool for the birds' comfort
is also a pretty as well as necessary adjunct to
the dove-cote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Birds add much to the pleasure of the garden.
Pigeons and doves give a poetic touch as they strut
along the paths and flutter about. Nothing gives
more quality and elegance, however, than a peacock,
and, to quote from a contemporary writer:</p>

<p>"The peacock is a bird of more beautiful feathers
than any other that is. He is quickly angry, but he
is goodly to behold, very good to eat, and serveth as
a watch in the inner court, for that he, spying
strangers to come into the lodging, he faileth not to
cry out and advertise them of the house."</p>

<p>The peacock is as much of a joy to the garden
lover as the sun-dial.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br />
<i>The Sun-dial</i></h2></div>


<p>The sun-dial forms a perfect ornament at the
intersection of the garden paths. Every one responds
to the quaint beauty and mystery of the sun-dial
with its dark shadow that creeps quietly across
the dial and tells the hours so softly. As Charles
Lamb says: "It is the measure appropriate for sweet
plants and flowers to spring by and birds to apportion
their silver warblings by." Nothing has a more
antique air than the sun-dial. The simple baluster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>pillar is a good model, and the base should be surrounded
by a circle of grass.</p>

<p>This grassy ring is the "wabe," Where Lewis Carroll's
"slithy toves" did "gyre and gimbel" in the
immortal poem "Jabberwocky."</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus36">
<img src="images/fig41.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center half">FOUNTAINS, SIXTEENTH CENTURY</p>
</div>

<p>The sun-dial can also be placed at the end of a
path, if the path is important enough to warrant it.</p>

<p>In our Shakespeare garden I suggest using a
Shakespearian quotation for the inscription, such as,
for example:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<i>The Terrace</i></h2></div>


<p>The terrace is essential, if one would have the
true Elizabethan atmosphere. The terrace can be
of stone, or brick, or brick combined with stone, or
brick combined with wood. Whatever the material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the balustrade is of the greatest importance. The
designs for balusters in the old architectural books
are legion, some of them of very complicated inter-twining
after the patterns of arabesques and <i>cuirs</i>
(strap-leather work), but good taste, even in that
day of complicated design, demanded that the balusters
should be very widely spaced. This is obvious,
because half of the effect, at least, of out-of-door
architecture depends upon the open spaces for light
to play its part&mdash;and a great part, too&mdash;in the
design. In balustrades the spacing is, therefore,
very important. The balusters should never be too
crowded. The most satisfactory ones are those in
which the distance from center to center almost
equals the height from plinth to coping. The piers
dividing the groups should not be too far apart&mdash;ten
to fifteen feet is a good distance. Much, however,
depends on the proportion of the balusters themselves.
Frequently the balustrade is adorned with
ornamental vases, or urns, set at regular intervals
on the rail and on the newel-posts of the steps. As
a rule, the steps lead from both ends of the terrace.
Sometimes there are also steps in the center; sometimes
the terrace is double. A jar, vase, or tub of
growing plants, or containing one handsome plant,
looks well placed on the lawn on either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
steps. Vines can be trained gracefully along the
balustrade, hand-rails, and posts of the steps. A
rich border of flowers should be grown all along the
side of the terrace: in the spring hosts of daffodils
and in the summer larkspur, marigolds, lilies, iris,
and climbing roses and honeysuckle. The terrace
gains in style and beauty when the proper floral
decorations are tastefully selected and well combined.</p>

<p>From the terrace one can enjoy a fine view of the
garden as a whole; and it is a pleasant place to
stroll upon and to sit. Sometimes the terrace is
of two levels with several stairways.</p>

<p>Leaving the architectural terrace, which is an
adjunct of the house bringing the house into relation
with the garden, we must turn to the garden terrace
made of grass, and ascended by grass steps cut in
the bank, or by stone or brick steps cut in the bank,
or standing outside with handrails and newel-posts.
If the steps are of grass, good effects can be made
by placing large jars, or tubs, filled with flowers,
ferns, or a single plant, such as the pomegranate,
for instance, on either side.</p>

<p>The grass-terrace is very charming leading up to
the garden, leading from one garden to another, or
leading from the lawn proper to the sunken garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
A very attractive arrangement was at Penshurst,
Kent, the home of the Sidney family. It is described
thus: "Garden on south and west, ground sloping
to south and west, house on a grass platform, about
nine feet above the garden level. Along the southwest
side of the flower-garden a broad grass-terrace,
and near the house a few steps lead to the yew alley,
at the end of which is a quaint old sun-dial known
as the Turk's Head."</p>

<p>The yew alley was evidently a pleached alley.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />
<i>The Pleached Alley</i></h2></div>


<p>The "Pleached Alley," another typical feature of
the Elizabethan garden (from the French <i>plessir</i>,
to weave), is nothing more nor less than a thickly
covered walk. In Shakespeare's time this was constructed
of woven boughs and climbing vines and
flowers, or a series of arbors. The old prints and
pictures show them to be complete tunnels of
greenery. We can make a pleached alley to-day by
setting up a pergola and smothering it with flowers
and vines. Ironwork arches covered with roses,
honeysuckle, and other creepers will produce the
proper effect. A latticework trellis covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
vines and flowers will, if properly constructed, produce
the appearance of a pleached alley.</p>

<p>When the pleached alley is not used to enclose
the garden, then a brick wall or, still better, a fine
hedge should be planted.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br />
<i>Hedges</i></h2></div>


<p>Box makes a perfect hedge. The hedge must be
clipped at the upper part narrower than at the base,
otherwise the base will become bare. Privet makes
an excellent hedge and so does the Osage orange,
which grows luxuriantly in some parts of the United
States. It is decorative to trim the hedge so that tall
pyramids ornament either side of the gate, or an
arch can be made to grow over the gate. A small
lavender hedge is very attractive. Each autumn,
after the flower-spikes have gone, trim plants for the
dwarf hedge.</p>

<p>Roses, particularly the sweetbrier, make a charming
hedge. Honeysuckle is another delightful flower
for a hedge; and nothing could be more beautiful
than the two combined.</p>

<p>If the rose and honeysuckle hedge is desired, have
the carpenter make a lattice screen of the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
height, or simply construct a rustic fence and plant
the creepers near it and train them so that they will
make a wall of flowers and leaves.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />
<i>Paths</i></h2></div>


<p>"There is no pleasanter path than that of grass,
and even the small garden ought to have a little
grass-walk between the flower borders and rose beds.
It adds immensely to the attractiveness of the garden
and none other is so pleasant to the tread. Constant
mowing and rolling are necessary and the
edges must be kept neat and trim; for while a well-kept
grass-path is most attractive of all, its charm
is never fully realized unless it is carefully attended
to."<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_92" id="Footnote_91_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> H. H. Thomas.</p></div>

<p>Gravel-paths must be frequently rolled and the
surface of the walk made a little higher in the center
than the sides with a curving outline, so that water
may drain away to the sides.</p>

<p>The brick pathway is capable of much variety.
Bricks may be laid in many patterns; and the little
garden, if very small, may be entirely paved with
bricks, leaving the formal flower-beds only of earth.
A fountain or sun-dial looks well in the center.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Flagged pathways are effective in certain garden
arrangements. Old paving-stones are suitable, but
they should first be broken up into irregular pieces.</p>

<p>"Build a good foundation, cover it with a thin
layer of sandy loam, then lay the larger pieces flat
on this. Fill the interstices with the fragments, but
leave crevices filled with soil, two inches or so wide,
here and there. Make up a compost of equal parts
of loam, sand and leaf-mould, sweep this over the
path and let it settle in the joints. Many plants
can be established in the joints and a pretty effect
obtained."<a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_92_93" id="Footnote_92_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> H. H. Thomas.</p></div>

<p>Among the plants practical for this purpose are
thrift, thyme, and camomile, and the more they are
trodden on the sweeter they smell and the better
they grow.</p>

<p>"The Gardener's Labyrinth" gives three or four
feet as the width for paths between beds and one
foot to one foot six inches for the cross-path.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />
<i>Borders</i></h2></div>


<p>Borders should not be confused with edgings.</p>

<p>"Border is the name applied to the narrow division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>of the garden which usually accompanies each
side of a walk. In fact, any bed which acts as a
boundary to a walk or grass-plot, or the main quarters
of a garden may be properly described as a
border.</p>

<p>"Flower-borders should be well drained. In plotting
them it must be remembered that if narrow no
art will impart to them an air of boldness. If the
pleasure grounds are small, narrow borders are permissible.
All flower-borders should be made in proportion
to the size of the garden and other surroundings.
Neatness must be the presiding deity
over flower-borders; and no application of the hoe
and rake, no removal of decayed leaves, no tying up
of straggling members can be too unremitting."<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

edited by Fraser and Hemsley (London, 1917).</p></div>

<p>According to Lawson, the borders "should be
roses, thyme, lavender, rosemary, hyssop, sage and
such like and filled with cowslips, primroses, violets,
Daffy-down-dillies, sweet Sissely, Go-to-bed-at-noon,
and all sweet flowers; and, chief of all, with
gilliflowers, July-flowers, commonly called gilliflowers
or clove July-flowers (I call them so because
they flower in July); they have the names of
cloves of their scent. I may well call them the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
of Flowers (except the rose). Of all flowers save
the Damask Rose they are the most pleasant to sight
and smell."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
<i>Edgings</i></h2></div>


<p>Edging is the material used for dividing beds
and borders from the paths, or grass leading up to
the bed, if the bed is alongside a wall, or terrace, or
veranda.</p>

<p>Box is a formal, but charming, edging. "The
growth must be regularly clipped each year. Stretch
a line the whole length of the edging, so as to show
the correct height; then cut evenly and neatly both
at top and sides. When relaying, take up the plants,
pull them to pieces and use the strong young
growths, which must be clipped to one level. Box
is easily grown and stands pruning with impunity."
Such is the advice of an authority. Another practical
gardener says: "Most amateurs clip box-edgings
early in the Spring. This causes an early
growth, which is just in the condition to be nipped
by a sharp, late frost. The safeguard is to delay
clipping until the end of August. Then comes free,
healthy growth, which renders box-lined garden
paths cheerful and pleasant to the eye through times
of heat and drought."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>Thrift (<i>Armeria</i>) is one of the best edgings as it
is green all the year round and in summer is covered
with bright pink flowers. A flower-lover says:</p>

<p>"Thrift is seen as an edging in many old English
gardens. To preserve its beauty the plants must be
lifted, divided and replanted once in at least four
years: a rich even growth is then the reward. The
tufted habit, fresh green growth and rose-purple
flowers in Summer are enjoyable to look at."</p>

<p>Thrift requires frequent trimming.</p>

<p>London-pride (<i>Saxifraga umbrosa</i>) is very pretty
when in flower and, therefore, makes an attractive
edging.</p>

<p>Pansies also form a decorative edging for flower
beds, large and small.</p>

<p>Another charming edging is the carnation, especially
the white varieties. The gray-green foliage
makes a beautiful border for flower-beds. Pinks are
pretty, too, for bed edgings, and the sweet-william
is also attractive for this purpose.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />
<i>Knots</i></h2></div>


<p>The knot should occupy a piece of ground from
twenty-five to one hundred feet square. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to "The Gardener's Labyrinth" "the flower-bed
should be kept to the size that the weeder's hands
may well reach into the middest of the bed." The
size given in this manual is twelve feet by six, "each
bed raised one foot above the ground (two feet in
marshy ground) and the edge cased in with short
planks framed into square posts with finials at the
angles with intermediate supports." A prettier
method, however, is to border the flower-bed with
an edging of box, thrift, pansies, or pinks. This
border outlines the shape of the knot. Within the
edging, or border, "the flowers are all planted in
some proportion as near one into another as it is fit
for them, which will give such grace to the garden
that the place will seem like a tapestry of flowers."</p>

<p>It would seem from the hundreds of designs for
knots in the old garden-books that every possible
combination of scroll and line and curve had been
exhausted; but ingenious persons liked to invent
their own. Markham tells us that "the pattern of
the design cannot be decided by rule; the one whereof
is led by the hops and skips, turnings and windings
of his brain; the other, by the pleasing of his
eye, according to his best fantasie."</p>

<p>Lawson gives the following nine designs for
knots:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>


<ul><li>Cinkfoyle</li>
<li>Flower-de-luce<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></li>
<li>Trefoyle</li>
<li>Frette</li>
<li>Lozenges</li>
<li>Cross-bow</li>
<li>Diamond</li>
<li>Oval</li>
<li>Maze.</li></ul>



<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94_95" id="Footnote_94_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> Fleur-de-lis.</p></div>

<p>Here the maze is not intended as a labyrinth to
walk in, but is a design for the planting of flowers.</p>

<p>Markham's knots are:</p>


<ul><li>Straight line knots</li>
<li>Diamond knots, single and double</li>
<li>Single knots</li>
<li>Mixed knots</li>
<li>Single impleate of straight line</li>
<li>Plain and mixed</li>
<li>Direct and Circular.</li></ul>



<p>Knots, formed with "a border of box, lavender,
or rosemary, are eighteen inches broad at bottom
and clipped so close a level at the top as to form a
table for the housewife to spread clothes to dry on,"
are Lawson's idea.</p>

<p>The old garden books contain many designs for
knots, some of which are astonishingly intricate.
Examples occur in Markham's and Lawson's books
and in Didymus Mountain's "Gardener's Labyrinth"
(editions of 1557, 1594, and 1608), which are perfectly
practical for use to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>In David Loggan's "Oxonia Illustrata" (Oxford,
1675, folio) several large plates show formal gardens.
Among them New College Gardens and those
of Jesus are extremely interesting. Loggan's companion
book on Cambridge, "Cantabrigia Illustrata"
(Cambridge, 1688), has splendid views of architecture
and formal gardens with knots.</p>

<p>Typical flower-beds are also represented in
Vredeman de Vries's "Hortorum Viridariorumque"
(Antwerp, 1583) and Crispin de Passe's "Hortus
Floridus" (Arnhem, 1614).</p>

<p>Theobald's as late as 1650 preserved the Tudor
arrangement.</p>

<p>"In the great garden are nine large complete
squares, or knots, lying upon a level in the middle of
the said garden, whereof one is set forth with box-borders
in the likeness of the King's Arms, one other
plot is planted with choice flowers; the other seven
knots are all grass-knots, handsomely turfed in the
intervals, or little walks. A quickset hedge of white
thorn, or privet, cut into a handsome fashion at
every angle, a fair cherry tree and a cypress in the
middle of the knots&mdash;also a marble fountain."</p>

Flowers that find a congenial home in a loosely arranged

<p><span class="lb">ANEMONE STELLATA</span> requires a sheltered,

most other plants fail. It can, therefore, be planted
on rough dry banks. It grows from seed; and this
can be sown in any sheltered place out of doors.
Cuttings placed in a frame are also easy to strike.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CAMOMILE</span> will grow in any garden soil. It is
a creeping plant and grows freely in dense masses.
The flowers are white and blossom from June to
August. The height attained is from twelve to
eighteen inches. The foliage is finely divided and
has a feathery appearance. The plant makes a good
border, for it loves the sun. Propagate by division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and cuttings. Camomile may be allowed to run over
paving-stones, for it grows when trodden upon.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CARNATIONS</span>. A carnation specialist says:</p>

<p>"A great number of amateur cultivators of the
Carnation have an idea that if they obtain seed from
a variety of Carnation, the seedlings produced from
such seed will be reproductions of the parent plant.
This, of course, is wrong, and it is well to mention
it. Now to grow Carnations well they must have a
good soil, or the plants will not produce flowers, or
layers, for another season. For the open garden, I
strongly recommend seedlings. The cultivator must
not expect all the flowers to be as good as the parent,
or even all double. There will be from ten to fifteen
per cent with single flowers, all the others having
double flowers, some as good as, or even better than
their parents; but the majority will be of uncertain
quantity.</p>

<p>"The seed will germinate in a hothouse well within
a week from the time of sowing, and the seedlings
should be pricked out in boxes as soon as large
enough. Plant in good soil and let the plants be
fifteen inches apart and two feet between the rows.
Seedlings are not nearly so particular in regard to
soil as-named varieties. The seedling is more robust;
and, given the same cultural conditions, grows more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>vigorously. It is always best to dig a trench some
time before the seedling is planted. This admits of
the soil being aerated. The plants should be put
out after a shower of good rain. I trench it eighteen
inches deep, put a layer of manure at the bottom
and another layer six or eight inches below the
surface.</p>

<p>"A warning is necessary to those unacquainted
with the nature of soils. It will not do to trench up
soil that has not been there before. New subsoil is
not adapted to grow anything until it has been well
turned over two or three times and mixed with decayed
manure.</p>

<p>"After planting, give a light dressing of manure:
it keeps the roots in better condition and the plant
starts more freely into growth. Carnations must
not be left to themselves after planting."</p>

<p>Gilliflowers, pinks, and sweet-williams belong to
this family.</p>

<p><span class="lb">COLUMBINES</span> prefer a situation where the
roots can obtain moisture. They also do well and
look at home in a rock-garden. "Gather ripe seeds
in July and sow them so that the seedlings are well
established before winter," an authority says.
"Such plants will bloom the next year. Aquilegias
often die out after their second year, although they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
are classed as perennials, and should therefore be
treated as biennials and raised annually from seed.
Seed is produced in abundance and should be sown
as soon as ripe in a shady place in the garden, or
in pans in a cold frame, care being taken to sow the
seed very thinly. When the seedlings are large
enough to handle they should be lifted and planted
out in their permanent quarters. Aquilegias growing
in a garden are almost invariably cross-fertilized;
and it is therefore necessary, where more than one
variety is in bloom at the same time, to procure the
seed from some other dependable source."</p>

<p><span class="lb">COWSLIP</span>. This flower needs a rich, light soil,
not dry. Its small, yellow cup-like flowers with ruby
spots in the center blossom in the late April and
late May. It grows to six or twelve inches and
prefers half-shade. It must be protected in the winter.
Propagate by seed. Cowslips make a charming
border plant and are happy, also, in rock-gardens.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CROCUS SATIVUS</span>, the beautiful purple flower
that blooms in autumn, should be planted near trees.
"The cultivation of the garden crocus is so simple
a matter that the merest novice may plant the bulbs
with the assurance that he, or she, will reap a bright
reward in the near future, provided the burrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
mouse and flower-picking sparrow do not interfere
with nature. Crocuses may be propagated from seed
sown as soon as ripe in light, sandy soil in pans, or
pots. They reach their flowering stage in three
years."</p>

<p><span class="lb">CROW-FLOWERS</span>. Some authorities, as we
have seen, identify crow-flowers as the buttercup;
others, as <i>Scilla nutans</i>. The buttercup is easy to
raise in almost any soil. As it should be represented,
it is well to put it in the rock-garden. See Harebell.</p>

<p><span class="lb">CROWN-IMPERIAL</span>. This plant, which the
people of Shakespeare's time valued so highly, is
rare in our gardens. The popularity of the flower
decreased because of its unpleasant odor; but no
Shakespeare garden can be without at least one representative
because of <i>Perdita's</i> words. The Crown-Imperial
is a very showy plant and makes a splendid
effect if planted in groups. It also looks well among
shrubs and in a border. The blossoms appear in
March, April, and May, and are very handsome as
to shape and color. The bell-shaped flowers,
orange-red or reddish-orange, droop gracefully beneath
an upright crown of leaves. When the foliage
turns brown, the plant can be cut down. Propagate
by offsets in deep, rich, well-drained soil, and divide
every two or three years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lb">CUCKOO-FLOWERS</span> (<i>Lychnis Flos cuculi</i>), or
the Ragged-Robin, with its deeply cut petals of rich
blue, makes a pretty border plant as it is an abundant
bloomer. (See <a href="#Page_214">page 214</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="lb">CUPID'S FLOWER</span>. See Pansy.</p>

<p><span class="lb">DAFFODILS</span> do better in half-shade than in
full sunlight. The earlier the buds can be procured
and planted the better: August is none too soon.</p>

<p>"Late planted bulbs must necessarily lose much
of their vigor by being kept out of the ground too
long, and the longer the period of root-growth the
stronger the flower-spikes. As regards soil one that
is fairly retentive of moisture is more suited to the
requirements than a light staple that soon dries up.
They should be covered to the depth of one and a
half times the depth of the bulb measured from base
to shoulder. A bulb two inches deep can be covered
to a depth of three inches, and so on in proportion.
In light soil the bulbs should be placed a little deeper
and in heavy soil not quite so deep."</p>

<p><span class="lb">DAISY</span>. In the spring florists have plenty of
English daisies to sell in little pots. Propagate by
seed in spring or division in September. This daisy
is pink and white; the little rays tipped with pink
sometimes almost cover the yellow center. The
plant requires rich soil and plenty of sunshine. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
blooms in mid-April to mid-June and grows to a
height of three to six inches. The daisy must be
protected in the winter. It is most desirable for
borders and makes a charming edging.</p>

<p><span class="lb">DIAN'S BUD</span>, <i>Artemesia</i>, or wormwood, is a
bushy foliage plant of small globe-shaped, drooping
flowers of whitish yellow. The leaves are finely divided.
Propagate by division. This grows in a
poor soil and likes sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="lb">FENNEL</span>, though regarded as a weed, can be
utilized so that it makes a decorative appearance,
for its foliage is light and a brilliant green. The
tiny flowers are yellow and grow in flat-tipped clusters
on branching stalks. They blossom in July.
The plant rises to a good height and prefers rich,
deep, open soil and plenty of sunlight. Plant fresh
seeds and make the plants grow in bold groups.</p>

<p><span class="lb">FERNS</span> are effective planted in pots, jars, or tubs,
and look well at the sides of the steps and on the
newel-posts of the steps. They look well in a rock-garden.</p>

<p><span class="lb">FLOWER-DE-LUCE</span> (<i>fleur-de-lis</i>). There are
many native American flags, or irises; but the plants
nearest to those described by Parkinson are the <i>Iris
florentina</i>, the <i>Iris pseudacorus</i>, and the great purple
Turkey flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Iris florentina</i> grows from one to two feet,
blooms in May and June, with large, delicately
scented white flowers tinted blue and streaked with
purple veins and having orange-yellow beards. The
fragrant rootstock is the orris-root. Propagate by
division in soil not too dry. This is an excellent
border plant and prefers half-shade.</p>

<p><i>Iris pseudacorus</i> grows from one and a half to
three feet and blossoms in late May and late June.
It forms luxuriant clumps, having many stems,
which bear large broad-petaled flowers, yellow
veined with brown. The leaves&mdash;long, stiff, and
gray-green&mdash;are handsome. This is a beautiful plant
for the margin of water, and is very pretty around
a bird-bath. Propagate by division. This iris likes
the sun.</p>

<p>The great purple Turkey flag will grow in either
sun, or half-shade. The height is from two to four
feet. The large fragrant flowers bloom in May,
June, and July. This iris is very handsome in large
groups and in the border. Propagate by division.
It is a gross feeder, but grows well in any garden
soil.</p>

<p><span class="lb">GILLIFLOWERS</span>. See Carnations.</p>

<p><span class="lb">HAREBELL</span>. This lovely jewel of the English
woodland has drooping bell-shaped flowers, fr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>agrant,
and blue in color. The bells hang from tall
stems. The leaves are long and grass-like. The
height is from eight to twelve inches. It is bulbous.
Propagate by offsets and give it occasionally a top
dressing of manure. <i>Scilla nutans</i> blooms in May
and June and prefers half-shade. There are varieties,
white, pink, and purple.</p>

<p><span class="lb">HOLLY</span> should be used for hedges and ornamental
bushes. Some varieties grow very well in certain
parts of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="lb">HONEYSUCKLE</span> grows easily in any garden.
It is a luxuriant creeper and is generous with its
blossoms and lavish in fragrance. Use it for hedges
and to climb over walls, arbors, trellises, gates and
wire screens.</p>

<p><span class="lb">IVY</span>. English ivy is a climbing and trailing evergreen
sub-shrub, with beautiful large, dark-green
leaves, richly veined, and of graceful heart-shape.
The flowers are inconspicuous, but the berries, almost
jet-black, are decorative. Propagate by half-ripe
cuttings in rich, damp soil and protect in winter.
Ivy prefers shade. It blossoms in June and
July.</p>

<p><span class="lb">LADY'S-SMOCK</span> (<i>Cardamine pretensis</i>) will
grow in sun, or shade, but prefers a moist soil.
Propagate by division. Its blossoms are pinkish lilac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
in terminal clusters and appear in June. The
foliage is deeply cut. Lady's-smocks will grow in
rock-gardens and are excellent border-plants.</p>

<p><span class="lb">LARK'S-HEELS</span>. See Nasturtium.</p>

<p><span class="lb">LARKSPUR</span> is a glorious flower, noble in masses
of bloom and fine in growth, highly decorative, and
lasts well besides. "Delphiniums are very easy to
grow and can be planted at almost any time, but the
best seasons are early autumn and spring when new
growth commences. The great point is to plant
them in rich well-dug and manured soil and strew
coal-ashes about for the reason that slugs are very
partial to these plants. Ample space must be left
for full development as with age the roots increase
greatly, so that two and a half feet apart is none
too much. The plant needs a rather rich ground,
for its growth is strong. Larkspur looks well planted
in the back row of the mixed border."</p>

<p><span class="lb">LAVENDER</span> is a precious, fragrant, hardy bush.
Its sweet-smelling leaves and blue flowers are ever
welcome, whether in the border, or as a low hedge,
or standing alone. A very light soil and sunshine
are essential. Propagate by cuttings in early autumn
out of doors in a sheltered, but not shady, place and
plant out when rooted, or divide in March, planting
out the rooted slips one foot apart in light soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Lavender may be used to beautify walks. Bushes
in some sunny corner of the garden are pretty for
picturesque growth and color. Lavender can be
grouped so as to give a touch of silvery gray to the
border. It permits itself to be clipped, and it must
be cared for, or it will grow twisted and gnarled. If
flower-spikes are desired, the lavender must be
clipped in autumn; if the gray leaf is all that is
desired then it must be clipped in the spring before
the young twigs have begun to grow.</p>

<p><span class="lb">LILIES</span>. The lily bed should be deep&mdash;three feet
if possible,&mdash;the soil open and porous without being
light. There cannot be a better material than sound
fibrous loam with which leaf-mold has been mixed.
Lilies are rarely benefited by animal manure. The
bed should be sheltered from boisterous winds, for
lilies lose half their beauty if it becomes necessary
to stake their graceful stems, and partially shaded
so that the sun does not parch the ground, or prematurely
wither their dainty petals. In times of
drought the beds should be given a copious <i>soaking
of an hour or two's duration</i>.</p>

<p>The Madonna Lily is a great favorite and is very
effective in small clumps against a background of
shrubs and in borders. Unfortunately it is subject
to disease. It is bulbous. Propagate by offsets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
scales, or very slowly by seed. It likes rich, well-dressed
soil and half-shade. Avoid contact with
manure. The Madonna Lily flowers in June and
July with white blossoms.</p>

<p>The Martagon has much reflexed flowers on long
spire-like racemes and is light-purple with darker
spots. The <i>Martagon dalmaticum</i> grows from six
to seven feet. It has dark purple flowers. There
is also a white kind. Both are very hardy and succeed
in open borders.</p>

<p>The <i>Chalcedonicum</i>, or Scarlet Turk's-Cap, grows
from three to four feet high and has waxy flowers
of bright vermilion. This is the <i>brightest</i> of all
lilies. It is very hardy and easy to cultivate.</p>

<p>Lily-of-the-Valley flourishes in the shade and also
where there is a little (but not too much) sunlight.
It thrives beneath shade trees and near a wall. <i>Room
for development it must have</i>; otherwise it becomes
crowded to such an extent that the plants deteriorate
and fail to bloom. The Lily-of-the-Valley should
be planted in September or October. Prepare the
soil by deep digging and mix in a plentiful supply
of decayed manure. Leaf-soil and road sweepings
may be added to heavy soil. Plant crowns about
three inches apart to allow room for future develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>ment.
Bury the crowns just below the surface and
make them moderately firm. When all are planted
mulch with rolled manure and leaf-soil in equal
parts, covering the bed to a depth of two inches.</p>

<p><span class="lb">LONG PURPLES</span>. This Arum, being a plant of
the woods, does well in the rock-garden. The best
plan is to remove a Jack-in-the-Pulpit from the
woods with some of its native soil and transplant it
in the garden. It grows in shade and sun alike.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MARIGOLD</span>. For marigolds choose a light, dry,
<i>poor</i> soil and a sunny spot. Sow seed any time from
February to June. Seeds sown in the spring will
produce flowers in June. Sow in drills ten inches
apart and water moderately. Thin the seedlings
and remove into rows ten inches apart. In rich soil
the plant grows too large and fails to blossom well.
H. H. Thomas in "The Complete Gardener" says:</p>

<p>"The ordinary reader understands Marigold to
refer to the French, African and Pot Marigolds. The
botanical name <i>Calendula</i> is said to imply that the
plant keeps pace with the calendar. In other words
that it is nearly always in bloom. And really this
is not very far from the truth. Once introduce the
Pot Marigold into your garden and you will rarely
be without flowers. It is hardy and seeds itself very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
freely. Seed may be sown out of doors where the
plants are to bloom, choosing for preference poor
ground, otherwise the plants will grow freely enough,
but blooms will be scarce."</p>

<p>The French marigold is deep yellow, orange, or
pale yellow striped or marked with brown, and
crinkled. It grows from twelve to fifteen inches
high. "The Gentleman's Labyrinth" gives quaint
instructions for the growth of the Marigold:</p>

<p>"The seeds of this flower are commonly bestowed
in a husbandly and well-dressed earth, but this
rather done by the counsel of the skilful in the increase
of the Moon, whereby the flowers may grow
the bigger and broader. But to procure the flowers
to grow the doubler, bigger and broader the owner
ought to remove the plants and set them in new
beds, lying in sunny places herein considering at
those times of removing that the Moon be increasing
so nigh as you can. These, after certain leaves
spring up, if they be often removed and clipped by
the course of the Moon, yield a better, broader and
fairer flower, and they yield always more flowers in
the harvest than in the spring time."</p>

<p><span class="lb">MARJORAM</span> is a branching plant with flowers
in clusters, purplish pink. Propagate by seed and
division in early spring in any garden soil. Sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
marjoram must be treated as an annual, for winter
kills it. The leaves are deliciously fragrant and are
useful in cookery.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MINT</span> (<i>Mentha spicata</i>, spearmint) has purplish
flowers that bloom in July and August. These blossoms
appear in slender spikes. The leaves have a
pleasant taste and are used for flavoring. Spearmint
will grow in any ordinary soil, but it likes the sun.
It grows from one to two feet high.</p>

<p><i>Mentha rotundifolia</i> has round leaves, variegated,
and pale yellow flowers that appear in June and
July. Propagate by division. The height is from
one to two feet. The flowers are unimportant; but
the foliage is sufficiently interesting to use as an
edging, and this variety is useful to cover waste
places.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MONK'S-HOOD</span> has large showy helmet-shaped
flowers of deep purple-blue growing on racemes on
erect stems. The leaves are deeply cut. The plant
is suited to borders and rough places. Propagate
by division in rich soil. Monk's-hood likes sun or
shade. It blooms in late summer or early autumn.
The roots and flowers are poisonous. It grows from
three to four feet.</p>

<p><span class="lb">MYRTLE</span> (<i>Myrtus latifolia</i>). This plant has
charming foliage and pure white flowers. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
leaves and flowers are fragrant. The fragrance of
the foliage is caused by an oil, which is secreted in
the leaves. Myrtle is quite hardy. Propagate by
cuttings, or partially ripened shoots. Myrtle looks
well in large pots.</p>

<p><span class="lb">NASTURTIUM</span>. <i>Tropæolum</i> is the botanical
name, meaning trophy, for the leaves suggest a buckler
and the flowers a helmet. Treat as a hardy annual.
Sow seeds in the spring. Nasturtium is a
splendid climber over rocks, stones, or latticework,
and a prolific bloomer.</p>

<p><span class="lb">OXLIP</span>. Propagate by fresh seed, divisions, or
cuttings in rich, light soil, not dry. <i>Protect in winter.</i>
The oxlip grows from eight to twelve inches
and likes half-shade. It resembles the primrose, but
has larger flowers. These open in May and are
yellow. The leaves are broad and flat and wrinkled.</p>

<p><span class="lb">PANSY</span>. Heart's-ease and Johnny-Jump-Up are
other names for the <i>Viola tricolor</i>, which has a wonderful
length of blossoming, for the flowers continue
from mid-April to mid-September. The flowers
must be constantly picked, or the plant deteriorates.
This precious little plant is very easy to raise, provided
it is protected from the noonday sun. Propagate
by seed or division in any garden soil, and in
half-shade or morning sunlight. Protect it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the hot noon-day sun. Pansies look well in a bed
by themselves and make a beautiful border plant.</p>

<p><span class="lb">PINKS</span>. See Carnations.</p>

<p><span class="lb">POMEGRANATE</span> is a highly decorative shrub,
particularly the beautiful double scarlet variety
(<i>Punica rubrum florepleno</i>), which flowers in August.
Plant cutting in a big pot, jar, or tub, or buy
plants. Stand these plants in pairs in some conspicuous
place in the garden and they will add great
elegance.</p>

<p><span class="lb">POPPY</span>. The common garden herbaceous poppy
flowers in May and June, in sun or half-shade, rising
from two to three feet. It has large flowers and
handsome divided foliage. For a Shakespeare garden
select the white. Propagate by dividing in early
autumn. The poppy is a gross feeder and likes
rather moist loam enriched with cow manure.</p>

<p><span class="lb">PRIMROSE</span>. This flower blooms from mid-April
to mid-June. It has several solitary pale yellow
blossoms on naked stem. It grows from six to
nine inches high. <i>Protect in winter.</i> Propagate by
seeds and offsets in rich, light soil, not dry.</p>

<p><span class="lb">ROSE</span>. "How to plant a rose may seem a simple
matter, but many have laid the foundation of failure
through bad planting," writes a rose cultivator.
"Never plant in a very wet soil, nor allow crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
manures to come into direct contact with the roots.
See that the roots are spread out properly and naturally,
not pressed into a small hole and cramped
or distorted from the first. Plant dwarf kinds two
inches deeper than the junction of the rose and stock,
and standards three inches below the original root.
To place a small grower side by side with one of
three or four times the strength is a great mistake;
the weaker grower has no chance whatever. For
medium growers three feet is a good distance, while
plants of greater vigor will need to be from four
feet to six feet apart. Do not plant <i>against</i> a wall;
but leave some four or six inches between the wall
and the base of the plant. It should not be difficult
to obtain the roses familiar to Shakespeare. The
old Hundred-Leaved and Damask are easy to procure.
The <i>Rosa alba</i>, or white rose, has two familiar
varieties called "Maiden's Blush" and "Madame
Plantier."</p>

<p>The Musk-Rose may give some trouble, but E. T.
Cook gives us a good clue as well as instructions
for growing it. He says:</p>

<p>"These are very old roses, certainly known in
England three hundred years ago. The flowers are
insignificant individually, but collectively are pleasing
and appear late in August. They require good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>culture, and very little, if any, pruning. As pillar
roses they are seen at their best. 'Fringed' is very
pretty and strikes freely from cuttings. Its color
is white shaded sulphur. All the Musk-Roses have
a peculiar musk-like odor, but this is distilled only
on still damp mornings or evenings. 'Eliza Verry'
is white, very free, the flowers appearing in large
corymbs. 'Rivers Musk' is a pretty pink variety,
well worth cultivating. Of the Hybrid Musks the
'Garland' is of rampant growth. It has immense
corymbs of tiny white flowers with innumerable little
buff colored buds, peering out among them.
'Madame d' Arblay' is another. 'Nivea' is a beautiful
kind for a pergola, or fence."</p>

<p>The "Noisette" is also a hybrid musk, named for
a French gardener of Charleston, South Carolina,
who took the seed from the musk-rose in 1817.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the Eglantine, or
Sweetbrier, and the Dog-rose, although they are difficult
to distinguish.</p>

<p>"The 'Dog Rose' sends up long arching branches
some six to nine feet high and perhaps more; the
'Sweetbrier' is content with branches three or four
feet in length. And whereas in the 'Dog Rose' the
branch continues single the 'Sweetbrier' sends out
side growths, or branchlets quickly forming a dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
bush. Note also the prickles. To a certain extent
they are stout and hooked like those of the 'Dog
Rose,' but more irregularly placed. On the young
root-shoots there is a marked difference, for whilst
on the 'Sweetbrier' this young growth is covered
with <i>setæ</i>, some of them very small, tipped with
glands, in the 'Dog Rose' they are totally absent."<a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="lb">ROSEMARY</span>. Tender, aromatic sub-shrub with
small flowers in short racemes. Propagate by seeds,
cuttings, or layers in dry, light soil. The flowers
are purple and bluish. Rosemary is valued in
cookery as a flavoring. It can be allowed to wander
all over the garden. It was always a favorite border-plant
in old-fashioned gardens.</p>

<p><span class="lb">RUE</span>. The "herb of grace" is not very pretty.
It has much divided leaves and panicles of small
fragrant flowers, yellowish-green, or greenish-yellow.
Propagate by seed and division. Rue needs
a sheltered position and protection in winter. Its
height is about two feet.</p>

<p><span class="lb">SAVORY</span>. Sow in open ground at the end of
March, or early April, in light, rich soil. Thin the
seedlings moderately; they may remain where they
are, or be transplanted. Sown along the outside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
beds, savory makes a good edging. It is useful in
cookery.</p>

<p><span class="lb">SWEET BALM</span>. <i>Melissa officinalis</i> is the botanical
name. Sweet balm is loved for its fragrance.
The yellowish white flowers bloom in June, July,
and August. It grows about two feet and loves the
sun. Propagate by seed and division.</p>

<p><span class="lb">SWEET-WILLIAM</span> is a valuable little garden
plant, for it blooms profusely in June and July and
is vigorous and rapidly spreading. The flowers are
in double clusters, pink, white, red, and party-colored,
single and double. Propagate by seed in
any soil. See Carnations.</p>

<p><span class="lb">THYME</span>. This aromatic herb is of dense growth
with small, pale-lilac flowers in terminal spikes. Its
pale, bright-green foliage makes it an attractive
creeper for banks. Thyme also grows well in a rock-garden
and makes a good border-plant also. Propagate
by seed and division. The plant grows in any
soil. It attains a height of from one to two inches
and blossoms in June and July. Every one knows
the value of dried thyme for flavoring in cookery.</p>

<p><span class="lb">VIOLETS</span> prefer shady places. They are at home
in the rock-garden, and they are very charming if
planted on a little bank. They can be sown on the
grassy slope of a terrace. In that case, let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
come up of their own sweet will. The graceful
heart-shaped leaves of the <i>Viola odorata</i> and its
purple blossoms that open in late April and May
are known and loved by every one. Propagate by
seed or division, selecting a loose, rich, sandy soil.</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br />
<i>Potpourri</i></h2></div>


<p>As the ladies of Shakespeare's time were so fond
of making <i>potpourri</i>, I think it may be of value to
place here an old recipe, which any one who has a
garden can follow:</p>

<p>"Many fragrant flowers and leaves can be used
in the making of an old-fashioned bowl of <i>potpourri</i>.
Those usually employed are rose-petals,
lavender, lemon-plant, verbena, myrtle, rosemary,
bay, mignonette, violets, pinks and syringa. Thyme,
mint and other sweet herbs should be used, if available.
Shred the larger leaves and dry all in the
sun. Mix an ounce of orris-root, allspice, bay-salt
and cloves and mix freely with about twelve handfuls
of the dried petals and leaves and store in a
jar, or bowl. A small quantity of essence of lemon
and spirits of lavender may be added, but are not
necessary. Should the mixture become too moist,
add more powdered orris-root."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>A MASKE OF FLOWERS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">IT seems to me that nothing more appropriate
could be placed here as an epilogue to this book
on the Shakespeare garden than the contemporary
description of "A Maske of Flowers by the
Gentlemen of Gray's Inn at Whitehall on Twelfth
Night, 1613, being the last of the solemnities and
magnificences which were performed at the marriage
of the Earl of Somerset and Lady Frances, daughter
of the Earl of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain."</p>

<p>This was printed in 1614; and I have quoted it
from the "History of Gardening in England" by
the Hon. Alicia Amherst (London, 1895), who
copied it from a very rare original.</p>

<p>This description not only presents a perfect picture
of a Shakespearian garden but will be a revelation
to those persons who think that only crude stage-setting
existed in Elizabethan and Jacobean days.
Although elaborate stage-setting was restricted to
private entertainments, the designers of the period
knew how to produce splendid effects. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
nothing more elaborate in the theater today than this
ornate and brilliantly lighted scene:</p>

<p>"When the Dance ended, the loud music sounded.
The curtains being drawn was seen a Garden of a
glorious and strange beauty, cast into four Quarters
with a cross-walk and alleys compassing each Quarter.
In the middle of the cross-walk stood a goodly
Fountain, raised on four columns of silver. On the
tops whereof strode four statues of silver which supported
a bowl in circuit containing four and twenty
foot and was raised from the ground nine foot in
height, in the middle whereof, upon scrolls of silver
and gold, was placed a globe garnished with four
golden mask heads, out of which issued water into
the bowl; above stood a golden Neptune, in height
three foot, holding in his hand a trident.</p>

<p>"The Garden walls were of brick, artificially
painted in perspective, all along which were placed
fruit-trees with artificial leaves and fruits. The
Garden within the walls was railed about with rails
of three foot high, adorned with balusters of silver,
between which were placed pedestals beautified with
transparent lights of variable colors. Upon the
pedestals stood silver columns, upon the tops whereof
were personages of gold, lions of gold and unicorns
of silver. Every personage and beast did hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
a torchet burning, that gave light and luster to the
whole fabric.</p>

<p>"Every Quarter of the Garden was finely hedged
about with a low hedge of cypress and juniper; the
Knots within set with artificial flowers. In the two
first Quarters were two Pyramids, garnished with
gold and silver and glittering with transparent lights
resembling carbuncles, sapphires and rubies.</p>

<p>"In every corner of each Quarter were great pots
of gilliflowers which shadowed certain lights placed
behind them and made resplendent and admirable
luster. The two farther Quarters were beautified
with tulips of divers colors, and in the middle and
in the corners of the said Quarters were set great
tufts of several kinds of flowers receiving luster from
secret lights placed behind them.</p>

<p>"At the farther end of the Garden was a Mount,
raised by degrees resembling banks of earth covered
with grass. On the top of the Mount stood a goodly
Arbor, substantially made and covered with artificial
trees and with arbor flowers such as eglantine,
honeysuckles and the like. The Arbor was in length
three and thirty foot, in height one and twenty, supported
with termes of gold and silver. It was divided
into six arches and three doors answerable
to the three walks of the Garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the middle of the Arbor rose a goodly large
turret and at either end a smaller. Upon the top
of the Mount in the front thereof was a bank of
flowers, curiously painted behind, while within the
arches the maskers sat unseen.</p>

<p>"Behind the Garden, over the top of the Arbor,
were set artificial trees appearing like an Orchard
joining to the Garden; and over all was drawn in
perspective a Firmament like the skies in a clear
night. Upon a grassy seat under the Arbor sat the
Garden Gods in number twelve, apparrelled in long
robes of green rich taffeta, caps on their heads and
chaplets of flowers. In the midst of them sat
Primaura, at whose entreaty they descended to the
stage, and, marching up to the King, sung to lutes
and theorbos."<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2></div>



<h2>ELIZABETHAN GARDEN AT SHAKESPEARE'S<br />
BIRTHPLACE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap2">TWO reports made in the spring of 1920,
one by Frederick C. Wellstood, secretary
and librarian of the Trustees and Guardians
of Shakespeare's Birthplace, and the other by Ernest
Law, C.B., one of the trustees, will doubtless be of
interest to the reader. They have been made available
through the courtesy of Mr. Law.</p>

<p>Mr. Wellstood, writing on Easter, 1920, in his
report says:</p>

<p>"The appeal of the Trustees and Guardians of
Shakespeare's Birthplace, &amp;c. issued three months
ago, for gifts of Elizabethan plants and flowers,
wherewith to stock his 'Great Garden' at Stratford-upon-Avon,
has had a very gratifying response. The
King and Queen, Queen Alexandra and the Prince
of Wales, have graciously interested themselves in
the project, and have given practical support by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
valuable contributions of old-fashioned roses and
other flowers.</p>

<p>"From the gardens of all the Royal Palaces, which
were known to Shakespeare, ample parcels of the
same sorts of flowers as grew in them when he visited
them have been forwarded to Stratford-upon-Avon.
Thus, from Greenwich, where we know that he appeared
as an actor before Queen Elizabeth at Christmas,
1594; from Windsor, where his Company performed
before the same Queen&mdash;probably in "The
Merry Wives of Windsor"&mdash;as well as from Frogmore,
which that play proves his acquaintance with;
from Hampton Court&mdash;out of the Old Tudor
Garden, 'circum-mured with brick,' which he must
have visited when he and his fellows of the 'King's
Company of Actors' spent ten days there during the
Christmastide of 1603-4, presenting six plays before
King James and his Court&mdash;from the gardens of all
these places large consignments of plants have
reached Shakespeare's Garden.</p>

<p>"From Wilton, likewise, where Shakespeare and
his Company first acted before King James, a large
number of specimens of every plant and flower
wanted by the Trustees, has been sent by the present
owner&mdash;the lineal descendant of the one, and the
kinsman and representative of the other, of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
'most noble and incomparable Paire of Brethren,
William Earle of Pembroke and Philip Earle of
Montgomery ... who prosequuted the Author
living with so much favor'&mdash;to quote the words of
the famous 'First Folio,' which was dedicated to
them.</p>

<p>"Similarly, from the gardens of other places,
which Shakespeare must have known well, have
come very welcome gifts, notably from Charlecote,
close to Stratford&mdash;the beautiful home of the Lucys
for 750 years, where Shakespeare is said when a
youth to have poached the deer of Sir Thomas Lucy,
who had him whipped for his offense&mdash;whence now
comes a charming collection of the poet's favorite
flowers from the direct lineal descendant and heiress
of the original 'Justice Shallow.'</p>

<p>"The trustees have also received choice batches of
old-fashioned flowers from the gardens of medieval
Castles mentioned in the plays&mdash;Glamis and Cawdor,
for instance&mdash;and some which were probably
well known to Shakespeare, such as Berkeley Castle;
and from the great Tudor houses also, which he
knew well, at any rate by repute, such as Knole,
Burghley House, and Cobham Hall. The owner of
Cobham Hall sends specimens of the famous 'Cobham'
Rose, known to have been grown in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
there for four or five hundred years. From Esher
Place also&mdash;the 'Aster House' of 'King Henry VIII'&mdash;come
many beautiful flowers and herbs.</p>

<p>"The sentiment, which has prompted such
generosity, has equally appealed to many possessors
of more modern gardens; while the authorities of
Kew Gardens, regarding the scheme as one of national
concern, have cordially aided the Trustees
both with counsel and with contributions.</p>

<p>"Last, but by no means least, are the many small
gifts from quite small gardens, even of cottagers;
while, in some ways, the most pleasing of all, are
the subscriptions from school children of some of the
poorest districts in the East End of London&mdash;for
instance, of the Mansford Street Central, and
Pritchard's Road Schools, Bethnal Green&mdash;for the
purchase of favorite flowers of the dramatist, whose
plays they have so often witnessed with delight at
the 'Old Vic.' and elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Thus, effect has been given to a prime desire of
the Trustees, that as large as possible a number of
people in every section of the community should be
associated with this tribute to Shakespeare's memory.</p>

<p>"Most of the plants needful to furnish forth
Shakespeare's garden in the style of his own time
have been forthcoming in sufficient quantities&mdash;yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
there are some important gaps still to be supplied.
These are:&mdash;Box, dwarf Box, both the ordinary
and the 'Gilded' variety; Thrift; Thyme, the Golden
and Glaucous, as well as the Wild; and that pretty
herb, known under its simple old English name as
'Lavender Cotton.' Of all of these, thousands of
plants are still needed. Similarly of Pinks,
'Streaked Gillyflowers'; 'Spike Lavender'; and of
Pansies&mdash;'Love in Idleness,'&mdash;pale and dark 'purple
with Love's wound.' Of 'Eglantine'&mdash;Sweet Briar&mdash;a
few scores would be very welcome.</p>

<p>"Such shortages are mainly due to the large
quantities of these plants required for the purpose
of filling the intricate-patterned beds of the 'Curious
Knotted Garden.' That kind of garden was an invariable
adjunct to every house of importance in
Shakespeare's time, and the Trustees are laying one
out on what is believed to be the exact site of the
poet's own 'knotted garden,' modeling it on the
designs printed in the contemporary books on gardening&mdash;the
designs being followed with a fidelity and
completeness unattempted, it is believed, for two
hundred and eighty years. At the same time, suggestions
have naturally been sought in Bacon's
famous Essay 'On Gardens.'..."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>


<p class="c medium">SHAKESPEARE'S GARDEN RESTORED</p>

<p>Mr. Law's report, which is dated "Shakespeare's
Birthday, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1920," says:</p>

<p>"The project of laying out the ground attached to
Shakespeare's home in his later years as an Elizabethan
garden, to be stocked with all the old-fashioned
flowers mentioned by him in his plays or
well known in his time, first took practical shape
last winter.</p>


<p class="c medium">THE LONG BORDERS</p>

<p>"The first step was to lay out the long, narrow
strip of ground by the side of the wall parallel with
Chapel Lane as a border for summer and autumn
flowers&mdash;hollyhocks, canterbury-bells, lupins, larkspurs,
crown imperials, lilies, and so on. As a background
for these&mdash;and also to hide the ugly, cast-iron
railings that disfigure the top of the wall&mdash;there
was planted a row of yew trees. This border of some
300 feet long has been treated in the formal fashion
of the olden time ... being divided into compartments,
separated by 'buttresses' supporting 'pillars'
or 'columns' surmounted by 'balls.'</p>

<p>"On the path side the beds are edged with box&mdash;'dwarfe boxe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>of excellent use to border up a knott
or long beds in a garden.'</p>

<p>"The beds ranging with these, on the other side
of the gravel walk, are at present entirely occupied
with spring flowers&mdash;largely gifts, like the others,
from contributors all over the kingdom. In the
summer they will be furnished with the low-growing
flowers known to the gardeners of the early years of
James the First's reign&mdash;carnations, 'our streaked
gillyvors,' pansies, stocks, fox-gloves, sweet-williams,
snapdragons, and so on....</p>


<p class="c medium">THE WILD BANK OF HEATH</p>

<p>"At the eastern or lower end of the garden the aim
has been to carry out, so far as the space available
admits, Bacon's idea, expressed in his famous essay
'Of Gardens,' of a 'heath or desert, in the going
forth, framed, as much as may be, to a natural wildness.'
With this object, there has been thrown up an
irregular bank, whereon have already been planted
most of the flowers and herbs mentioned by Shakespeare
in his writings; and where, it is hoped, every
species known in his time will eventually find a
place.</p>

<p>"In doing this the great natural philosopher's precepts
have been faithfully followed, modified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
hints derived from the greater poet. 'Some thickets,'
says Bacon, 'I would have made only in sweetbriar
(eglantine) and honeysuckle (woodbine); and the
ground set with violets and primroses (oxlips); for
these be sweet and prosper in the shade.' This has
been done: and with wild thyme&mdash;many square
yards of it&mdash;added, and also musk-roses&mdash;a few procured
with great difficulty, so unaccountably
neglected are they in our too-pretentious modern
gardens&mdash;they will form here, in effect, Titania's
Bower&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There sleeps Titania some time of the night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lull'd in these flowers, with dances and delight.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Bacon, of course, often witnessed the performances
of Shakespeare's plays at Court, as well as
in the public theaters; and reminiscent echoes of that
beautiful passage were probably ringing in his ears
when he penned the sentences quoted above.</p>

<p>"With passages in plays other than 'The Dream,'
Bacon has also parallels. His essay happens to have
been published exactly twelve months after the production
of 'A Winter's Tale' at Court, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
somewhat arid enumeration therein of the seasonal
succession of flowering plants, we seem to hear echoes
of those exquisite verses in Perdita's speeches&mdash;the
most beautiful expression of the intimate love of
flowers in all literature&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"... Daffodils,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That come before the swallow dares, and take</span><br />
<span class="i0">The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That die unmarried ere they can behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bright Ph&oelig;bus in his strength.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"'For March,' writes Bacon, 'there come violets,
especially the single blue, which are the earliest ...
and which, above all other flowers, yields the sweetest
smell in the air; also the yellow daffodil.' 'Lilies
of all sorts, the flowre-de-luce being one,' says Perdita.
'Flower-de-Luces, and lilies of all natures,'
echoes Bacon.</p>

<p>"Near the Wild Bank later on there may, perhaps,
be planted some of those specimens of the topiary
art, which were so general in Jacobean gardens.
Even Bacon would admit them into his 'Princely
Garden.' 'Little low hedges (of box or yew),' he
writes, 'round like welts, with some pretty pyramids,
I like well, and in some places fair columns.' But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
would confine them to geometric patterns: 'I, for
my part, do not like images cut out in juniper or
other garden stuff, they be for children.' But then
Shakespeare had children and grandchildren; and,
besides, many children of the present day will visit
his garden, much taken, we may be sure, with such
curious devices, and delighting in our simple sweet
old English flowers&mdash;very few of them, it is to
be hoped, serious little prigs, bursting with
botany....</p>


<p class="c medium">THE "KNOTT GARDEN"</p>

<p>"It is now necessary to say a few words about the
'Knott Garden'&mdash;an enclosure which, being an invariable
adjunct to every house of importance in
Shakespeare's time, is the most essential part of the
reconstruction, on Elizabethan lines, of the ground
about New Place. It need not, however, engage us
long: for M. Forestier's beautiful drawing of it represents
it as it is to be, better than any amount of
wordy description.</p>

<p>"The whole is closely modeled on the designs
and views shown in the contemporary books on
gardening; and for every feature there is unimpeachable
warrant. The enclosing palisade&mdash;a very
favorite device of the Jacobean gardeners&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Warwickshire oak, cleft, is exactly copied from the
one in the famous tapestry of the 'Seven Deadly
Sins' at Hampton Court. And here again Bacon's
advice has been useful: 'The garden is best to be
square, encompassed on all four sides with a stately
arched hedge, the arches on pillars of carpenter's
work, of some 10 foot high, and 6 foot broad.' The
'tunnel,' or 'pleachéd bower, where honeysuckles,
ripened by the sun, forbid the sun to enter'&mdash;follows
ancient models, especially the one shown in the old
contemporary picture in New Place Museum.</p>

<p>"The dwarf wall, of old-fashioned bricks&mdash;hand-made,
sun-dried, sand-finished, with occasional
'flarers,' laid in the Tudor bond, with wide mortar
joints&mdash;is based on similar ones, still extant, of the
period. The balustrade is identical, in its smallest
details, with one figured in Didymus Mountain's
'Gardener's Labyrinth,' published in 1577&mdash;a book
Shakespeare must certainly have consulted when laying
out his own Knott Garden. The paths are to be
of old stone from Wilmcote, the home of Shakespeare's
mother. The intricate, interlacing patterns
of the Knott beds&mdash;'the Knottes so enknotted it cannot
be expressed,' as Cavendish says of Wolsey's
garden&mdash;are taken, one from Mountain's book; two
from Gervase Markham's 'Country Housewife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Garden' (1613); and one from William Lawson's
'New Orchard and Garden' (1618); and they are
composed, as enjoined by those authorities, of box,
thrift, lavender-cotton, and thyme, with their inter-spaces
filled in with flowers.</p>


<p class="c medium">ROYAL ROSES FOR THE KNOTTED BEDS</p>

<p>"In one point the Trustees have been able to 'go
one better' than Shakespeare in his own 'curious
knotted garden'&mdash;to use his own expression in
'Love's Labour's Lost.' For neither King James, nor
his Queen, Anne of Denmark, nor Henry Prince of
Wales sent him&mdash;so far as we know&mdash;any flowers
for his garden. On his 356th birthday, however,
there will be planted four old-fashioned English
rose-trees&mdash;one in the center of each of the four
'knotted' beds&mdash;from King George, Queen Mary,
Queen Alexandra, and the Prince of Wales. Surely
Shakespeare, could he have known it, would have
been touched by this tribute!</p>

<p>"They will be planted by Lady Fairfax-Lucy, the
heiress of Charlecote, and the direct lineal descendant
of the Sir Thomas Lucy whose deer he is said
to have poached, and who is supposed to have had
him whipped for his offense, and who is believed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
be satirized in the character of 'Justice Shallow.'
This also might well have moved him!</p>

<p>"Here, in the restored 'Knott Garden,' as everywhere
in the grounds about New Place, flowers&mdash;Shakespeare's
Flowers&mdash;will clothe and wreathe and
perfume everything, all else being merely devised to
set them off&mdash;musk-roses, climbing-roses, crab-apples,
wild cherries, clematis, honeysuckle, sweetbriar,
and many more.</p>

<p>"By next year, the Trustees expect to have some
200,000 individual plants&mdash;including, of course, the
crocuses, 'bold oxlips,' 'nodding violets,' 'winking
marybuds,' 'pale primroses,' and 'azured harebells,'
on the wild bank and lawn&mdash;decking, in succession
through the months, the ground whereon the poet
trod, their millions of blossoms, with every breath of
air doing reverence, waving banners of gorgeous hue,
and flinging the incense of their delicious fragrance
in homage to the memory of William Shakespeare."</p>
